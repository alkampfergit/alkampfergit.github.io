TFS 2010 build system is based on Workflow Foundation and this means that you can extend writing custom activities (I blogged quite a lot about TFS Build in the past) or using legacy MSBuild actions. With this release you have now 100 new Actions / Activities you can use in your builds as well as a big amount of source code to understand how you can write extensions for Tfs Build System.</description></item></channel></rss>
