We have a simple page that shows a list of objects of type A; for each line there is a button called Associate, that opens a modal-like dialog where the user can search objects of type B. Each result of this search show a button call Select to associate that object to the A object.</description></item><item><title>jQuery to the rescue - some numbers</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/05/jquery-to-the-rescue-some-numbers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2009 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/05/jquery-to-the-rescue-some-numbers/</guid><description>In an old project I have a particular user control dedicated to identify data stored in a tree. The user can type some letters, and press Search button to find all the elements that match the search, or it can use a series of DropDownList to navigate from the higher element down to the hierarchy. It is used extensively in the site, and is used even to select location, from a table where location are stored in Nations, Region, Province and Location.</description></item><item><title>Aspnet Mvc plus jQuery client template engine have fun with them</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/04/aspnet-mvc-plus-jquery-client-template-engine-have-fun-with-them/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2009 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/04/aspnet-mvc-plus-jquery-client-template-engine-have-fun-with-them/</guid><description>jQuery has really a lot of interesting plugins, but the one I like most is a template engine called jtemplates. Basically it consist of a jQuery extension that is capable of rendering html with javascript on client machine. You really have a lot of flexibility on how to specify a template, basically you can embed it into an hidden textarea, the one you see in the above sample is created in this way</description></item><item><title>Create a list of attachments with jQuery and ajax calls</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/04/create-a-list-of-attachments-with-jquery-and-ajax-calls/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2009 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/04/create-a-list-of-attachments-with-jquery-and-ajax-calls/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve found this exceptional component to do file upload with jQuery and ajax call. I have a page where I need to edit a domain entity that have a property of type List&amp;lt;FileAttach&amp;gt;, and I need to permit to the user to easily add and remove attachments. The asp.net webform where this control resides is quite complex, so I really want to avoid a full page postback each time the user want to Add, remove or download an attachment.</description></item><item><title>Microsoft Ajax ScriptManager and AspNet MVC</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/04/microsoft-ajax-scriptmanager-and-aspnet-mvc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2009 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/04/microsoft-ajax-scriptmanager-and-aspnet-mvc/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m porting a sample application from asp.net to MVC, I used this app to make my session during last DotNetMarche event dedicated to JQuery. Now I&amp;rsquo;m writing the same sample pages in asp.net mvc to compare both technologies. In an Asp.Net page I showed how to use jQuery to do Edit in place of some Photo Description in an application that manages photo album. At a certain point my jQuery script will communicate with the server through an asmx webservice exposed with a ScriptManager.</description></item><item><title>Transition between images in jQuery</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/03/transition-between-images-in-jquery/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2009 13:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/03/transition-between-images-in-jquery/</guid><description>Sometimes it is needed to change an image into another image, if possible with a smooth transiction. There are a lot of solution to the problem, but one of the simpliest approach is using the background of a containing div. Here is a possible and really raw solution

Writing a plugin is a breeze, and here an example of your first JQuery plugin, a logger to the firebug console.
Firebug is de facto the best developer tool for web developer I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used, and its console logging features are really amazing. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it can help JQuery progammers.
