They ceased to work with no reason, both on my blog and guardian&amp;rsquo;s one (&lt;a href="http://www.nablasoft.com/guardian">www.nablasoft.com/guardian&lt;/a>). After a couple of days, we still do not know why, it seems that suddenly, with no apparent reason, some setting on php.ini are now ignored. I know that wordpress in IIS has some problems with permalink, but with &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/?p=274">fix_pathinfo&lt;/a> trick everything worked for more than one year. Now if I look at the info.php on nablasoft site, I do not find the fix_pathinfo anymore, even if the ini file is correct. Probably we need to restart IIS, but we are on a shared site, and this is simply not possible. We are trying to use 404 redirection, but.. again, we cannot do this from our control panel, so we are waiting for our host to do this. In the end&amp;hellip; we have a lot of troubles.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome to New Nablasoft Blog</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/08/welcome-to-new-nablasoft-blog/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2008 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/08/welcome-to-new-nablasoft-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>I forget to welcome &lt;a href="http://www.nablasoft.com/guardian">guardian’s home&lt;/a> the new blog of another nablasoft member. After long time it seems that he now realized that blogging is a real interesting activity to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since He is a better graphic designer than me (I think I can tell the same of everyone, I’m a really poor graphic designer) he spent some time to improve the look of the site….it reminds me that I really need to improve the layout of my blog.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google analytics</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/05/google-analytics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 May 2007 02:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/05/google-analytics/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have to admit that WordPress is a great blog engine, today I activated google analytics, and after a 10 seconds search I found a plugin to insert automatically the analytics code in the blog. I must admit that even if I’m a.NET programmer php blogs such WordPress are still superior.&lt;/p>
