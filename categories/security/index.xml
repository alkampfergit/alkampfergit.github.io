And this because, actually, using merge will make your repository history a mess.
For a lot of years, this kind of suggestion was not so common. I&amp;rsquo;ve always looked at the teams happily used merge and then complain about how difficult is to read the story of the repository.</description></item><item><title>GitHub Copilot-X in action: simple code conversion</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/copilot-x-chat-rewrite/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/copilot-x-chat-rewrite/</guid><description>New Copilot X from GitHub is the next big thing for programmers, because it brings the power of copilot to the next level. Actually I&amp;rsquo;m testing the integrated chat in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. The tool is not always perfect, but we really need to understand how and where to use it to gain maximum advantage.
We often encounter conversion operations that are very mechanical, boring, and prone to errors due to their repetitiveness.</description></item><item><title>Troubleshooting GitHub Codespaces PGP Signing Problems</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/codespaces-troubleshooting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/codespaces-troubleshooting/</guid><description>If you use GPG keys to verify your commits, you&amp;rsquo;ll be glad to know that in GitHub Codespaces, signing is done automatically. All you need to do is configure the settings in your account, and a key will be injected into your Codespaces. As a result, every commit you make in your Codespace will be automatically signed and verified.

Now my goal is configuring data protection api for multiple instance of a software, so we need to share keys in a shared location and at the same time keep them secret. Luckily enough .NET core already has everything we need.
The overall solution will need two parameter to our program, Folder where to store keys and a certificate thumbprint to protect the keys.</description></item><item><title>Accessing Office 365 with IMAP and OAuth2</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/security/accessing-office-365-imap-with-oauth2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 10:13:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/security/accessing-office-365-imap-with-oauth2/</guid><description>The situation I&amp;rsquo;ve had the need to upgrade some code that uses IMAP folder to download email, and it uses sometimes Office365 accounts, but Microsoft will remove in the future basic auth as described here in favor of OAuth2 based authentication. This is a good move because Basic Auth is not really secure, and with modern authentication and OAuth2 you can force two factor auth and other more secure login alternative.</description></item><item><title>Developers and TLS what could possibly go wrong</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/security/developers-and-tls/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2022 08:13:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/security/developers-and-tls/</guid><description>The problem of not using TLS in developer machines Lots of time ago, at the time Windows Communication Foundation was a thing, there were good automatic protections by Microsoft that prevent passing credentials in clear text over an unencrypted (non TLS) channel. I was amazed by the number of solution you can find in the internet that to solve the problem suggests to developer to create an unsecure channel that does not perform this check, allowing for clear text credential to be sent in a standard HTTP channel.</description></item><item><title>How to handle certificate error in dotnet WebClient object</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/security/handle-certificate-errors-in-dotnet-webclient/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 08:14:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/security/handle-certificate-errors-in-dotnet-webclient/</guid><description>The situation This is a simple scenario: I use a WebClient object in .NET to perform some web request to a target web site, everything went good except when the code runs in Xamarin Android, where it throws an exception in https connection.

If you are running CI workflows in your machine where you control the code that is build and every script that is run by CI engine, you are pretty fine. In that scenario an attacker should take control of your code to run some malicious script during a CI run, but if you are using a third party task/extension/action, the situation is different.</description></item><item><title>Choose environment from branch in GitHub action</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/choose-environment-from-branch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/choose-environment-from-branch/</guid><description>I have a friend that asked me how to choose an enviroment in a GitHub action based on the branch that triggered the action. Usually Environments are used in a sort of Promotion mechanism, where you start deploying on Test, then you have a manual or automatic approval to deploy on staging and finally to production. Even if this is a textbook scenario sometimes you need to create a simple sequence of steps to deploy your software in an environment and you want to choose environment based on branch.</description></item><item><title>GitHub security scan - an example</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/security/github-security-scanning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 15:10:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/security/github-security-scanning/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve already blogged on the security scanning capability offered by GitHub and in this post I want to give you another example on a possible output. In previous example I&amp;rsquo;ve shown a result that is quite simple the library identified a usage of ECB in AES encryption and flagged it as a wrong usage of crypto api. It is interesting but less impressive, after all it simply spotted the usage of an enum value related to a vulnerable CypherMode, something that it easy to spot.</description></item><item><title>Playing with Cryptography, Part 1</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/security/playing-with-cryptography-part1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 09:13:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/security/playing-with-cryptography-part1/</guid><description>Cryptography is a fascinating subject, surely complex, but as a developer you probably have some predefined libraries in your language/environment of choice that you can use.
