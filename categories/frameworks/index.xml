The problem is the following: you have a site hosted with IIS in the computer you are logged in, the site has windows authentication, but you cannot login using a FQDN, but only with localhost. This is a Security Feature, because it avoid a reflection attack if the machine gets compromised. Sometimes this is annoying when you develop, because you are usually using your IIS machine to host site while you are developing, accessing it with localhost; then it is necessary to verify that everything works with real site names.</description></item><item><title>Wcf over HTTPS compression binary binding and some measurement</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/09/wcf-over-https-compression-binary-binding-and-some-measurement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 20:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/09/wcf-over-https-compression-binary-binding-and-some-measurement/</guid><description>I’ve an application that is composed by WPF clients deployed over the internet and a central WCF service exposed over Https for security reason , everything works fine, but as the number of clients grows, performance starts to decrease a little. Since I have a great number of clients that operates behind a single standard ADSL 8 MBit (used for everything, mail, browsing, etc..), I measured and found that bandwidth is becoming a bottleneck, so I need to reduce amount of traffic between clients and server.</description></item><item><title>Masstransit latest version even simpler than ever</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/09/masstransit-latest-version-even-simpler-than-ever/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 19:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/09/masstransit-latest-version-even-simpler-than-ever/</guid><description>In a recent post about Masstransit I’ve explained how to setup communication using a Subscription Service, and this configuration needs a dispatcher that can be build directly from MassTransit source code. If you do not want to have a central dispatcher, because you need to install a windows service (or run program in console) and a sql server used by the dispatcher you can also avoid this using Multicast.
The key is the call to sbc.</description></item><item><title>Masstransit and dispatching of messages</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/09/masstransit-and-dispatching-of-messages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Sep 2012 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/09/masstransit-and-dispatching-of-messages/</guid><description>One of the coolest aspect of Masstransit is simplicity of use (even if it still lacks a really comprehensive documentation ), dispatching of message is one of this aspect. The key of Masstransit is that dispatching is done on type of the message instead that address, we can simply ignore everything in the middle, we have just components that declares to Masstransit that they are able to handle a certain type of messages, other components will simply publish messages in the bus and dispatching is done thanks to the CLR type of message sent.</description></item><item><title>Quick start on Mass Transit and MSMQ on windows</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/08/quick-start-on-mass-transit-and-msmq-on-windows/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Aug 2012 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/08/quick-start-on-mass-transit-and-msmq-on-windows/</guid><description>MassTransit is a bus implementation for.NET that promise frictionless configuration and simple usage. The main problem about MassTransit in my opinion is the lack of organic documentation, especially a quick start guide that shows you really the basic concepts behind MassTransit. If you jump into online documentation there is a nice page called “Show Me the code” that promise a quick start to jump into MassTransit concepts. The problem with that example is that it shows a single snippet of code that opens a bus based on Windows MSMQ and send a message to itself.</description></item><item><title>Case sensitivity in lucene search</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/07/case-sensitivity-in-lucene-search/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jul 2012 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/07/case-sensitivity-in-lucene-search/</guid><description>Getting Started With Lucene.NET Searching and more detail on Documents Fields Advanced Queries with Lucene.NET We ended last post with a good knowledge of how to do complex searches in Lucene.NET indexes but a question remains unresolved, is Lucene.NET search case insensitive or case insensitive?.

Part 1 – Basic of IoC unity container
Part 2 – Basic of resolving dependencies and configure objects.
Now it is time of AOP and using Policy Injection Application Block. AOP it is a very interesting technique, used to inject behavior on a class at runtime. To use AOP with Unity and policy injection application block you should wrap the instances returned by the Unity container as shown in this snippet.</description></item><item><title>Other experiments with Unity</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/01/other-experiments-with-unity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2009 02:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/01/other-experiments-with-unity/</guid><description>Yesterday I give a look at unity, an Inversion Of Control container made by Microsoft, today I’m experimenting a little more to have more confidence with it.
An IoC container not only permits to resolve a concrete entity, but it also permits you to configure it. Here is how you can set a simple property on an object.

When you work with nhibernate you can use show-sql configuration parameter to instruct nhibernate to show generated sql, but how can you see this output in a running windows application? You should know that NHibernate has various log4Net logger, and you can instruct the session to dump all sql code to a logger, here it is a possible configuration</description></item><item><title>Again on INotifyPropertyChanged and POCO object</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/08/again-on-inotifypropertychanged-and-poco-object/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2008 04:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/08/again-on-inotifypropertychanged-and-poco-object/</guid><description>In this post Matteo shows that if you build a dynamic object to create a proxy that implements INotifyPropertyChanged this does not works with BindingList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.
First of all I want to say that my previous two post were made only to show how to create a proxy, I really believe that using Dynamic Code Generation to implement Interfaces like INotifyPropertyChanged is not a good idea.
The greatest problem with dynamic objects is that the *type is known only at run time, and not at compile time,*this means that at compile time you cannot make any supposition on the proxy itself.</description></item><item><title>Writing a custom formatter for log4net</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/04/writing-a-custom-formatter-for-log4net/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2008 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/04/writing-a-custom-formatter-for-log4net/</guid><description>Log4Net is certainly one of the most important instrumentation library for logging.

Unable to read the specified saved state. The configuration data may be invalid.
after some minutes wendering in internet trying to find a solution I check the cc.net directory, in my server is D:\CruiseControl\CruiseControl.NET\server. Now in this directory there are some files with stateextension, one for each project.</description></item><item><title>A new container for Inversion of Control</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/02/a-new-container-for-inversion-of-control/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2008 14:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/02/a-new-container-for-inversion-of-control/</guid><description>I’ve stumbled onto Autofac, this seems to be a new IOC container, that promise good thing….maybe it’s worth to take a look at.

Here is a stupid example. When you have to transfer data to the UI, usually you do not want to pass to the UI the real object of the domain, but it is better to use some DTO. Converting a list of domain object into DTO can be a boring issue, but with linq it is really simple.</description></item></channel></rss>
