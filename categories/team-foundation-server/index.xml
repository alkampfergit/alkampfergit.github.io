If you have open source project it made lot of sense to use a public account in SonarCloud , so you do not need to maintain a sonar server on-premise and you can also share your public account with the community.
For open source projects, SonarCloud is available for you with zero effort and thanks to VSTS and TFS you can automate the analysis with few steps.</description></item><item><title>VSTS TFS use Wildcards for continuous integration in Git</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/02/vsts-tfs-use-wildcards-for-continuous-integration-in-git/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2018 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/02/vsts-tfs-use-wildcards-for-continuous-integration-in-git/</guid><description>If you setup a build in VSTS / TFS against a git repository, you can choose to trigger the build when some specific branch changed. You can press plus button and a nice combobox appears to select the branch you want to monitor.

This means that if you add feature/1312_languageSelector, each time a new commit will be pushed on that branch, a new build will trigger.</description></item><item><title>TFS 2018 is out time to upgrade</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/11/tfs-2018-is-out-time-to-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2017 19:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/11/tfs-2018-is-out-time-to-upgrade/</guid><description>Some days are passed, but it is good to remind you that TFS 2018 is finally out. Some people are surprised because after TFS 2015 we had TFS 2017 and we are still in 2017 and we already have version 2018, but this is the good part of the ALM tools in Microsoft, they are really shipping tons of new goodness each year :).
Release note page contains all the details about the new version, from that link you have a small 13 minute video that explain what is new in this version and as usual in the page you have a detailed list of all the news with detailed information about each of the new features.</description></item><item><title>VSTS build failed test phase but 0 tests failed</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/11/vsts-build-failed-test-but-0-test-failed/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Nov 2017 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/11/vsts-build-failed-test-but-0-test-failed/</guid><description>I had a strange situation where I have a build that suddenly starts signal failing tests, but actually zero test failed.

This is the typical task that you write and forget, because it just works and you usually not have the need to upgrade it. But there is a build where I start to see really high execution timing for the task, as an example GitVersion needs 2 minutes to run.</description></item><item><title>Use different Excel TFS VSTS Addin at the same time</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/09/use-different-excel-tfs-vsts-addin-at-the-same-time/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Sep 2016 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/09/use-different-excel-tfs-vsts-addin-at-the-same-time/</guid><description>If you are a consultant, it is quite common that you work with various version of TFS Server at the same time.

Microsoft test newer version of TFS against lots of applications to be sure that newer versions of TFS do not break usage of existing tools.</description></item><item><title>Running Unit Tests on different machine during TFS 2015 build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/06/running-unit-tests-on-different-machine-during-tfs-2015-build/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jun 2016 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/06/running-unit-tests-on-different-machine-during-tfs-2015-build/</guid><description>First of all I need to thanks my friend Jackob Ehn that pointed me to the right direction to create a particular build. In this post I’ll share with you my journey to run tests on a different machine than the one that is running the build.

The build produces a zip file that contains everything needed to install the software, then we have a script that accepts the zip file as parameter as well as some other parameters and does install sofwtare on a local machine
This simple paradigm is perfect, because we can manually install a software launching powershell, or we can create a Chocolatey package to automate the installation.</description></item><item><title>Getting Work Item data in powershell through REST API</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/01/getting-work-item-data-in-powershell-through-rest-api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2016 17:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/01/getting-work-item-data-in-powershell-through-rest-api/</guid><description>VSTS and the latests versions of on-premise TFS has the ability to access data through REST API . This way to access TFS data is really convenient expecially if used from PowerShell scripts, because you do not need any external dependency, except being able to issue REST requests with the Invoke-RestRequest cmdlet.
To simplify accessing your VSTS account, you can enable alternate credentials, needed to issue request with simple Basic Authentication.</description></item><item><title>Build vNext support for deploying bits to Windows machines</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/06/build-vnext-support-for-deploying-bits-to-windows-machines/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2015 13:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/06/build-vnext-support-for-deploying-bits-to-windows-machines/</guid><description>One of the most interesting trend of DevOps movement is continuous deployment using build machines. Once you get your continuous build up and running, the next step is customizing the build to deploy on one or more test environments. If you do not need to deploy in production, there is no need of a controlled release pipeline (Ex: Release Management) and using a simple build is the most productive choiche. In this scenario one of the biggest pain is moving bits from the build machine to target machines.</description></item><item><title>Microsoft support for non Windows developers</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/05/microsoft-support-for-non-windows-developers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2015 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/05/microsoft-support-for-non-windows-developers/</guid><description>During Build 2015 conference Microsoft announced** ** Visual Studio Code ** , a free IDE to develop web, cloud and modern application **.

In a small shops usually there is no dedicated resource to maintain TFS installation , usually you install the first time, schedule backup and everything is done. In small company maintenance is also simple, you usually have not big database and speed is not a problem with current hardware.
Some people also fear the upgrade, because they think it is a complicated process, they are not sure if they are able to restore the old version if the upgrade went wrong, and so on.</description></item><item><title>Versioning assembly during TFS 2013 build with Powershell Scripts</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/01/customize-tfs-2013-build-with-powershell-scripts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2014 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/01/customize-tfs-2013-build-with-powershell-scripts/</guid><description>One of the most important news in TFS Build 2010 is the introduction of Workflow Foundation that replaced standard MSBuild scripts used in TFS 2008. Workflow foundation can be really powerful, but indeed it is somewhat scaring and quite often customizing a build can be complex.

This works perfectly even on TF Service (tfs.visualstudio.com) because the Elastic Build is configured to restore packages during build. This is really cool, until your build start to fail for missing references.</description></item><item><title>Visual Studio ALM Links- Week 42013</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/01/visual-studio-alm-links-week-42013/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jan 2013 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/01/visual-studio-alm-links-week-42013/</guid><description>Other enhancements in Microsoft Test Manager in Update 1 Add additional States onto the Agile Task Board in TFS2012 How to enable the Backlog view in TFS 2012 web access Team Foundation Server Vs.

Tfs does not have a standard way of doing this, but with a couple of MsBuild actions it is really simple to overcome this limitation. This is a good example that shows how you can extend build script to do complex task.
First of all I want to change only AssemblyFileVersion and not the AssemblyVersion, in this way all builds are compatible until someone manually changes AssemblyVersion.</description></item><item><title>Integrate Nunit test into a Tfs build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/07/integrate-nunit-test-into-a-tfs-build/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2009 20:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/07/integrate-nunit-test-into-a-tfs-build/</guid><description>Since a lot of people use NUnit testing framework, it is of high importance knowing how to fully integrate nunit test runner inside a tfs build. The overall problem is that you can create a custom task, or using an existing one to run nunit tests, but the main problem is integrating nunit output with standard tfs output. The problem and a possible solution is described here.
This means that someone had already solved this problem for us :), and created an xslt that transforms a nunit-style output into a mstest-style output (.</description></item><item><title>Customize test running in a Tfs Team Build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/06/customize-test-running-in-a-tfs-team-build/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2009 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/06/customize-test-running-in-a-tfs-team-build/</guid><description>In previous post I showed how to setup a build in tfs that not only builds the solution, but also runs all the tests. The next step is to configure how tests are run and reacting to test result. The first thing I want is the ability to make the entire build fail if one of the test fails. As you see in the previous post, the default behavior of the build, is to partially fail if one or more tests fail.</description></item><item><title>Team foundation Build - Share Builds among multiple servers</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/06/team-foundation-build-share-builds-among-multiple-servers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2009 12:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/06/team-foundation-build-share-builds-among-multiple-servers/</guid><description>When you begin to use Team Foundation Server, you will create different builds for all of your company&amp;rsquo;s projects. Since building complex products can be resource intensive, it is likely that your Team Foundation Server machine starts to perform slowly. This is a typical issue of Continuous integration servers, since they compile projects at each check-in you will end with a lot of builds and a lot of work to do.</description></item><item><title>Creating a build with Tfs</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/06/creating-a-build-with-tfs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2009 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/06/creating-a-build-with-tfs/</guid><description>I worked for long time with NANT + CC.net as continuous integration tools. I used subversion as Source Control System and use Mantis or Redmine for issue tracking.
The main disadvantage of using such a configuration is the need to make each tool communicate with others, the good part is that these tools are open source. Team Foundation Server on the other side is a Commercial tool, so you have to pay it, but it gives you a lot of features in a single unified tool, and this is Great.</description></item></channel></rss>
