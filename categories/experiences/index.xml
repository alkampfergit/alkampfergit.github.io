Quite often having or not having an SSD is not the real problem, because developers works with machine with low ram and slow disks and this is especially true for people working with laptop, that often uses 5.400 standard RPM disks.
It is difficult to understand how much minutes or hours per day a developer can save moving from an average speed hardware to a top speed hardware and without these numbers it is difficult to justify the expense of buying top speed hardware.</description></item><item><title>The good part of having a lot of RAM</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/09/the-good-part-of-having-a-lot-of-ram/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2011 13:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/09/the-good-part-of-having-a-lot-of-ram/</guid><description>I’ve learned in the past a precious rule about hardware: try to imagine how you will use your pc in at least one or two years period before thinking to buy some piece of hardware.

The main reason is that Brian had really wrote tons of good code and it is really interesting knowing how he organize his projects. From this first post I strongly agree with a couple of concepts, the first is having a clean code at regular interval, no longer than few hours.
I made mistake in the past, and sometimes in the present, I begin coding a super new feature, with a lot of code, and after some hours I have nothing working because I&amp;rsquo;m still doing infrastructure code, etc etc.</description></item><item><title>Speedup Visual Studio with faster disk</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/speedup-visual-studio-with-faster-disk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2009 04:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/speedup-visual-studio-with-faster-disk/</guid><description>We always know that to speedup visual studio a fast disk is quite always a good choice, but what is best configuration?

The obvious solution is using the same password for every site, but this is really insecure, if some site does not protects well my password (store it in clear text), a malicious user can grab username and password and can try to use it for other sites.</description></item><item><title>Crunch mode is effective</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/08/crunch-mode-is-effective/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2008 04:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/08/crunch-mode-is-effective/</guid><description>I stumbled on this post of Marco, that directed me on the original post, speaking about crunch time.

It is not important what kind of Lifecycle you can have, from waterfall to Extreme programming, you will have some sort of documentation that needs to be shared among team members. The format of this documentation can vary, it can be composed by word document, UML diagrams, and whatever you like but it must satisfy some key requirements</description></item><item><title>Working with distributed team 8211 VPN and source control</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/05/working-with-distributed-team-vpn-and-source-control/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2008 23:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/05/working-with-distributed-team-vpn-and-source-control/</guid><description>Another great tool for distributed teams is VPN (Virtual Private Network), with a VPN all the team members can live in the same virtual local network. This is important, first of all for security. VPN estabilish a secure channel between computer using an insecure transport as the internet, with wpn all the data is ciphered, so you can transmit company sensitive data with easy.
To estabilish a vpn you should have the Dedicated Server I told you some days ago, and then you should decide how to create VPN.</description></item><item><title>Working on a distributed enviroment 8211 The server</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/05/working-on-a-distributed-enviroment-the-server/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2008 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/05/working-on-a-distributed-enviroment-the-server/</guid><description>As I said in a previous post I worked mainly in a distributed environment. Such a kind of development requires some attention to avoid losing productivity because each member of the team is physically far from the other.
The first think you need is buy a Dedicated Server on some web farm. You need a dedicated server, and not a simple hosting, because you need full control of the machine, you should be able to install services, restart the machine and so on.</description></item><item><title>Working in distributed environment</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/05/working-in-distributed-environment/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2008 02:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/05/working-in-distributed-environment/</guid><description>In the last years I worked mainly in distributed environment, with a company based in Milan (Italy), We have a development group distributed along the nation, and I would share my opinion and experiences about such a particular environment. First of all I wish to enlist the good and bad thing based on this experience.
Good:
I work mainly at home, no need to get machine to go to work, I do no waste time in physically move my person to an office, my house is my office.</description></item><item><title>Programming Experience a reflection on</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/05/programming-experience-a-reflection-on/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2008 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/05/programming-experience-a-reflection-on/</guid><description>This evening I’ve added a new category on the blog, and it’s called “*Experiences”,*and someone could ask why.
In these days I was thinking about my past experiences in programming or related stuff in these years. I’ve begin programming with the Vic20, when the prefix Mega appears only in science Fiction, now we speak about Tera and the world of technology is definitively changed a lot since these days.
This makes me think about how a person increase his/her knowledge during his/hers life.</description></item></channel></rss>
