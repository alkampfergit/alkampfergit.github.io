Situation: we deployed new version of a web application based on ASP.NET Web API, it was a small increment (we deploy frequently), but suddenly the customer starts experiencing slowness of the application and intermittent errors.</description></item><item><title>Load Security Alerts in Azure Application Insight</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/08/load-security-alert-in-azure-application-insight/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/08/load-security-alert-in-azure-application-insight/</guid><description>Security is one of the big problem of the modern web, business moved to web application and security become an important part of application development. One side of the problem is adding standard and proved procedure to avoid risk of basic attacks like SQL or NO SQL injection, but big part of security was programmed at application level. If you are using SPA with some client framework like Angular and have business logic exposed with API, (Ex ASP NET Web API), you cannot trust the client, thus you need to validate every server call for authorization and authentication.</description></item><item><title>Exclude Folders from SonarQube analysis</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/exclude-folders-from-sonarqube-analysis/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2017 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/exclude-folders-from-sonarqube-analysis/</guid><description>Creating a build that is capable of perform a SonarQube analysis on a VSTS / TFS is a really simple task, thanks to the two tasks that are present out-of-the box.

Upgrading from 5.1 to 5.3 should be a simple task, but I had a couple of problems. I’ve followed the official upgrade instruction: http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Upgrading but the first problem was my connection string to SQL Server, that needs to be changed. Original connection string was
sonar.jdbc.url=jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://localhost/Sonar;SelectMethod=Cursor;instance=sqlexpress
But it seems that with the new version of Solr it needs to be changed because jtds is not anymore used.</description></item><item><title>BufferingAppenderSkeleton performance problem in log4net</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/03/bufferingappenderskeleton-performance-problem-in-log4net/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2015 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/03/bufferingappenderskeleton-performance-problem-in-log4net/</guid><description>The problem Today I was working to Jarvis project and I got a warning from another developer telling me that MongoDbAppender for Log4net slows down the application during a full Rebuild of all projections. In that specific situation we have log level set to DEBUG and the rebuild generates 800k logs inside mongo database, so I’m expecting Mongo Appender to slow down a little bit. The problem is: using a standard FileAppender to verify difference in speed it results that the FileAppender was really faster than the MongoDbAppender.</description></item><item><title>How to Deploy Web Site with PowerShell DSC</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/06/how-to-deploy-web-site-with-powershell-dsc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2014 05:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/06/how-to-deploy-web-site-with-powershell-dsc/</guid><description>I do not want to create another tutorial on DSC and I suggest you reading some introductory articles like: Introducing PowerShell Desired State Configuration before reading this article.

With version 4 it added a really cool capability called CQLinq or Code Query Linq; an amazing feature that permits you to query your code using LINQ stile queries. Basically after I’ve analyzed a solution I got presented with a simple dialog that asked me what I’m interested to do primarily with the result of the analysis.</description></item><item><title>Git is fantastic but IMHO too complex to use</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/08/git-is-fantastic-but-imho-too-complex-to-use/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2012 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/08/git-is-fantastic-but-imho-too-complex-to-use/</guid><description>I’ve blogged some time ago on the basic fact that I’m not a Git lover and a couple of days ago I stumbled upon this post (10 things I hate about Git), where the author did a full explanation of various reason why he does not like Git.

If you use log4Net you can download a Mongo appender capable of storing logs inside mongo with few lines of code and you are ready to go.
The original appender is really good but I’ve done a little modification to make it capable of storing complex item in extended properties, just locate the function LogginEventToBSON and modify the section that stores Composite Properties with following code</description></item><item><title>List of interesting open source project for TFS hosted on Codeplex</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/codeplex-project-for-tfs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Mar 2012 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/codeplex-project-for-tfs/</guid><description>Some times ago I blogged a series of links of useful tools for TFS.

My actual configuration consists of Three disks, two of them are 10.000 RPM Western digital, with 16 MB cache configured in RAID 1 array with a dedicated adaptec RAID card. Then I have a secondary 7.200 Disk that I use to store temporary backup, download, and file of little importance.</description></item><item><title>Resharper and switch to a different solution</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/01/resharper-and-switch-to-a-different-solution/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2009 05:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/01/resharper-and-switch-to-a-different-solution/</guid><description>When I close a solution from visual studio quite often resharper does not release memory
To show this information you can simply go to Resharper-&amp;gt;options and in the General section under System check the &amp;ldquo;show managed memory usage in status bar&amp;rdquo;
As you can see I store caches in TEMP folder, this because I have two disks, so I prefer to keep caches in a disk different from the one used to store source code, in this way overall disk usage is better.</description></item><item><title>Performance of logging system</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/11/performance-of-logging-system/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2008 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/11/performance-of-logging-system/</guid><description>When you insert a logging system into your application you should do some preliminary test for performance issue. The most important thing is that logging infrastructure should not introduce too much overhead when the log is disabled. With log4net you have different way to handle the log, suppose you have a logger and the DEBUG level is disabled; you can use one of these three form

1 2 3 catch { LogException(.... This type of exception handler catch everything and log, despite the fact that is not so good practice to catch every exception that a piece of code could raise, one of the most frustrating thing is that if you place a breakpoint in the LogException line, since you have not specified in the catch clause no exception you have no way to see detail of the exception.</description></item><item><title>Resharper and plugins</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/07/resharper-and-plugin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2008 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/07/resharper-and-plugin/</guid><description>Version 4.0 of resharper offers the ability to create plugins. This is very important, because you can use the basic structure of resharper to offer additional features. One of the most interesting, in my opinion, is the NHibernate plugin, I suggest you to have a try of it, another good reason to use resharper ;).

At the first glance the library is really good, but a simple thing appears to be missing (or probably I did not find in the documentation)
I need to examine a large set of feed to grab all the link, but I do not know if the feed is rss or atom or whathever else, I decided to support atom and Rss, and I created this little piece of code that use GenericSyndicationFeed to load the feed from the uri, then check the format and create the correct feed component.</description></item><item><title>The heartbeat of a project</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/05/the-heartbeat-of-a-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2008 01:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/05/the-heartbeat-of-a-project/</guid><description>Continuous Integration is one of the most important part of a project, it gives the heartbeat of the code, when it is green the beat is ok, when it is red something wrong is occurred.
