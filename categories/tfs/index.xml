Here is what you can read in release notes
Basic authorization is now enabled on the communication between the TFS and Search services to make it more secure. Any user installing or upgrading to Update 3 will need to provide a user name / password while configuring Search (and also during Search Service setup in case of remote Search Service).</description></item><item><title>TFVC shell extension now published as standalone tool</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/03/6959/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Mar 2018 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/03/6959/</guid><description>Finally TFVC shell extension was published as a standalone tool.

Figure 1: General Service Unavailable error for TFS Web interface
This error happens most of the time if you have wrong user credentials in the worker process used by IIS to run the TFS Application. To verify this assumption, you can simply open IIS Manager console and verify the status of the worker process that is used to run IIS ( Figure 2 )</description></item><item><title>Increase RAM for ElasticSearch for TFS Search</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/01/increase-ram-for-elasticsearch-for-tfs-search/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2018 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/01/increase-ram-for-elasticsearch-for-tfs-search/</guid><description>If you are experiencing slow search in TFS with the new Search functionality based on ElasticSearch a typical suggestion is to give more RAM to the machine where ES is installed. Clearly you should use HQ or other tools to really pin down the root cause but most of the time the problem is not enough RAM, or slow disks. The second cause can be easily solved moving data to an SSD disk, but giving more RAM to the machine, usually gives more space for OS File cache and can solve even the problem of slow disk.</description></item><item><title>Monitor TFS Search data Usage</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/01/monitor-tfs-search-data-usage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2018 12:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/01/monitor-tfs-search-data-usage/</guid><description>In previous post I’ve explained how to move searches component in a different machine in a TFS 2018 installation, now it is time to understand how to monitor that instance. First of all you should monitor the folder that physically contains data, in my installation is C:\tfs\ESDATA (it is a parameter you choose when you configure the Search Server with Configure-TFSSearch.ps1 -Operation install PowerShell script). Data folder should be placed on a fast disk, usually SSD are the best choice.</description></item><item><title>TFS 2018 search components in different server</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/01/tfs-2018-search-components-in-different-server/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2018 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/01/tfs-2018-search-components-in-different-server/</guid><description>When it is time to design topology of a TFS installation, for small team the single server is usually the best choice in term of licensing (one one Windows Server license is needed) and simplicity of maintenance. Traditionally the only problem that can occur is: some component (especially the Analysis and Reporting services) starts to slow down the machine if the amount of data starts to become consistent.
Single machine TFS installation is probably the best choice for small teams.</description></item><item><title>Migrate your TFS to VSTS</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/12/migrate-your-tfs-to-vsts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Dec 2017 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/12/migrate-your-tfs-to-vsts/</guid><description>I’ve discussed a lot with many customers over the benefit of VSTS over TFS, especially for small companies, where there is no budget for a dedicated TFS administrator. The usual risk is not updating TFS, loosing the update train and then have a problem doing upgrades like TFS 2008 to TFS 2017.
For those realities, adopting VSTS is a huge benefit, no administration costs, no hardware costs, automatic upgrade, accessible from everywhere , same licensing (license for VSTS are also valid for TFS) and much more.</description></item><item><title>Decide to publish artifacts on Server or Network Share at queue time</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/decide-to-publish-artifacts-on-server-or-network-share-at-queue-time/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2017 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/decide-to-publish-artifacts-on-server-or-network-share-at-queue-time/</guid><description>A build usually produces artifacts and thanks to the extreme flexibility of VSTS / TFS Build system, you have complete freedom on what to include as artifacts and where you should locate them.
Actually you have a couple of options out of the box, a network share or directly on your VSTS / TFS Server. This second option is especially interesting because you does not need a special network share and you do not have permission issue (every script or person that can access the server and have build permission can use the artifacts).</description></item><item><title>Hyper-V and Windows AutoLogon</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/hyper-v-and-windows-autologon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2017 19:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/hyper-v-and-windows-autologon/</guid><description>When you configure build agents and especially when you configure Release Agents for VSTS, it is quite normal to have some installations where you want to use AutoLogon. This is needed whenever you want to run integration tests that needs to interact with the UI. Having autologon enabled avoid the need to manually login and start the agent when the machine is rebooted, because you always have a user session opened that runs the agent.</description></item><item><title>Deploy test agent and run functional test tasks</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/deploy-test-agent-and-run-functional-test-tasks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2017 19:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/deploy-test-agent-and-run-functional-test-tasks/</guid><description>In VSTS / TFS Build there are a couple of tasks that are really useful to execute UAT or Functional tests during a build. The first one deploy the test agent remotely on a target machine while the second one runs a set of tests on that machine using the agent. If you use multiple Run Functional Test task, please be sure that before each task there is a corresponding Deploy test agent tasks or you will get an error.</description></item><item><title>Add a capability to agent in a Deployment Group</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/add-a-capability-to-agent-in-a-deployment-group/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2017 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/add-a-capability-to-agent-in-a-deployment-group/</guid><description>When you deploy a Build agent in VSTS / TFS, in the administration page you have the ability to add custom Capabilities to the agent, as you can see in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Adding capabilities to a standard build agent.
With the new Release Management, you can install agents in machine that will be added to Deployment Groups. If you look at the UI, you can see that the capabilities tab is listing all the capabilities of the agent, but you have not the option to specify custom capabilities.</description></item><item><title>Publish a website available only in some branches with VSTS build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/publish-a-website-available-only-in-some-branches-with-vsts-build/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2017 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/publish-a-website-available-only-in-some-branches-with-vsts-build/</guid><description>I have several builds that publish some web projects using standard msbuild task.

Previous build system, based on XAML and Workflow Foundation allows you to specify really complex path of execution, but the side effect is that builds become really complex, they are painful to edit and also, you need to use Visual Studio to edit. Final drawback is that writing and maintaining custom build activities was not so easy, because you need to keep the compiled version in line with build engine version.</description></item><item><title>Running powershell before Get Sources in VSTS TFS Build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/06/running-powershell-before-get-sources-in-vsts-tfs-build/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jun 2017 13:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/06/running-powershell-before-get-sources-in-vsts-tfs-build/</guid><description>I have a VSTS build where I need to run a PowerShell scripts at the very beginning of the build, before the agent starts downloading the sources , and it seems that this cannot be done with a simple task, because there is no way to place a task before the Get Sources default task of VSTS Build.
Luckily enough there is a way to solve this problem, because each task can define a specific script that should be run when the build starts and before each task runs , here is how.</description></item><item><title>Troubleshoot a failing build a Winrm story</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/06/troubleshoot-a-failing-build-a-winrm-story/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2017 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/06/troubleshoot-a-failing-build-a-winrm-story/</guid><description>Many VSTS build and deploy tasks are based on Winrm to operate on a remote machine , one of the most common is the “Deploy Test Agent on” that will install a test agent on a remote machine.

If you are not in a domain Winrm can be a really thought opponent, especially because the target machine is not part of the same domain and is not trusted.</description></item><item><title>Publish nuget package during build NET Standard</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/05/publish-nuget-package-during-build-net-standard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2017 20:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/05/publish-nuget-package-during-build-net-standard/</guid><description>In a previous post I dealt with how to build a Multitargeted dotnetcore solution in VSTS, but the build is not really complete unless you are publishing the result somewhere. Since my example was a simple library, the obvious solution is publishing everything to a nuget feed.
Publishing with nuget is really really simple with VSTS build system , because you should simply use another.NET Core task instance plus a NuGet publisher.</description></item><item><title>Run Pester in VSTS Build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/05/run-pester-in-vsts-build/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2017 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/05/run-pester-in-vsts-build/</guid><description>I’m not a great expert of PowerShell, but during last years I’ve written some custom utilities I’m using for various projects. The main problem is that I’ve scattered all these scripts on multiple projects and usually I need time to find the latest version of a script that does X.
Scattering PowerShell scripts all around your projects lead to error and a maintenance nightmare
To avoid this problem, the obvious solution is starting a consolidation of PowerShell scripts and the obvious location is a Git repository hosted in VSTS.</description></item><item><title>Error during dotnet restore in a VSTS Build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/05/error-during-dotnet-restore-in-a-vsts-build/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2017 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/05/error-during-dotnet-restore-in-a-vsts-build/</guid><description>I’ve a build that runs perfectly on some agents, but fails in others, and the error is in the dotnet restore action.

Microsoft ensure that old tools (like VS 2010) always can connect to latest version of TFS, but the opposite is not true. This means that new version of Visual Studio could have problem connecting to older instances of TFS.
Keeping your TFS updated will guarantee that you can use TFS with newer and older tooling (yes, even Visual Basic 6 can work with TFS 2017)</description></item><item><title>Check pull request with build without enforcing pull request</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/05/build-pull-requests-without-policies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2017 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/05/build-pull-requests-without-policies/</guid><description>With TFS / VSTS Build system it is possible to configure Git to require that a specific branch is protected, and you need to use Pull Requests to push code into it, and the pull request can be accepted only if a specific build is green. Here is the typical configuration you can do in admin page for your Git repositories.

To minimize this problem VSTS contains a Settings tab in pool configuration that allows scheduling of Agent Maintenance job as you can see in Figure 1.

One of my favorites is the simple extention point to write a custom task to perform custom operation. The whole process is really simple and is described in this post.
One of the major problem when you manage a task is versioning, because you can have lots of builds using that task and if an update require to break the compatibility with the past, releasing a new version can really be a nightmare of many broken build.</description></item><item><title>One reason to upgrade to TFS 2017 Code search</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/01/one-reason-to-upgrade-to-tfs-2017-code-search/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2017 17:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/01/one-reason-to-upgrade-to-tfs-2017-code-search/</guid><description>I always suggest teams to use VSTS instead of on-premise TFS. The main reason is avoiding any issue with administration or upgrades. In these years, one of the main risk of having TFS on-premise is not planning for upgrade and keeping the first version installed for years. As a result, it is not uncommon to have teams that still uses TFS 2013 even if version 2017 is out.
For small teams usually there is not a dedicated TFS administrator; in this situation is it strongly advisable not to skip one entire major upgrade, to minimize the risk of a big bang upgrade.</description></item><item><title>Building with agent without Visual Studio installed</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/01/building-with-agent-without-visual-studio-installed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2017 17:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/01/building-with-agent-without-visual-studio-installed/</guid><description>I had a build that runs fine on some agents, then I try running the build on a different agent but the build failed with the error.

Whenever you write tools that interact with VSTS / TFS you need to decide how to authenticate to the server. While for TFS is quite simple because you can simply run the tool with Active Directory user and use AD integration, in VSTS integrating with your AD requires more work and it is not always a feasible solution.</description></item><item><title>Import a Git Project with REST API between VSTS Team Projects</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/10/import-a-git-project-with-rest-api-between-vsts-team-projects/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2016 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/10/import-a-git-project-with-rest-api-between-vsts-team-projects/</guid><description>I’ve got an interesting question about the possibility to import via REST API a Git Repository between Team Projects of VSTS.

The reasons behind the need to completely remove Lab Management configuration could be various, one of the most common is: you created a cloned copy of your TFS environment for testing purpose, and you want to be 100% sure that your cloned instance does not contact SCVMM, or you can simply have multiple Test TFS Instance and you need to move lab management from one instance to another.</description></item><item><title>Create a safe clone of your TFS environment</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/08/create-a-safe-clone-of-your-tfs-environment/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2015 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/08/create-a-safe-clone-of-your-tfs-environment/</guid><description>ChangeServerId to avoid confusion of client tools Around the web there are a lot of resources about how to create a clone of your TFS environment for testing purpose.

The downside of this approach, is that every person is able to add whatever tag to work items with the risk of misspelling and duplication.
As an example if the team is doing T-Shirt sizing for User Stories, we can have people using tag S to identify a Small Story, then people decides to change to SIZE_S to better indicate the purpose of the tag.</description></item><item><title>Manage Artifacts with TFS Build vNext</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/06/manage-artifacts-with-tfs-build-vnext/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2015 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/06/manage-artifacts-with-tfs-build-vnext/</guid><description>Artifacts and Build vNext Another big improvement of Build vNext in TFS and VSO is the ability to **explicitly manage the content of artifactsduring a build **.

The downside of this approach is that your infrastructure become full of agents, and you should have some way to determine which agent(s) to use for a specific build. The problem is:
avoid running builds in machines that are “not appropriate” for that build.
Running on a specific agent If you are customizing a build, or if you are interested in running the build on a specific agent in a specific machine (ex: local agent), the solution is super easy, Just edit build definition and in General tab add a * demand *named Agent.</description></item><item><title>TFS New Build System vNext agents</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/06/tfs-new-build-system-vnext-agents/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2015 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/06/tfs-new-build-system-vnext-agents/</guid><description>With the latest Visual Studio Online update, the new build system is now online for all users.

This scenario usually ends in being not able to configure Deployment Agents in those machines due to various authorization problems.</description></item><item><title>Professional Team Foundation Server 2013</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/05/professional-team-foundation-server-2013/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2014 17:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/05/professional-team-foundation-server-2013/</guid><description>If the book “Professional Application Lifecycle Management With Visual Studio 2013” is the perfect companion for all members of a software project team using Visual Studio ALM ecosystem, Professional Team Foundation Server 2013 is aimed mainly to “TFS Administrators”.

The account you are using to perform the migration should be in the Team Project Collection Service account because it need special permissions. Suppose you are using the Brian Keller’s Virtual Machine, you decide to perform the migration with Adam Barr, you need to be sure that the user is part of the Team Project Collection Service account Unfortunately when is time to add a user in that group, you will find that the UI does not allow you to do this, so you need to add the group to the user, not the user to the group, here is the sequence of operations that accomplish this operation.</description></item><item><title>Collaboration providers for Team Foundation Server</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/01/collaboration-providers-for-team-foundation-server/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2013 17:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/01/collaboration-providers-for-team-foundation-server/</guid><description>I want to signal you this project on codeplex (http://tfscollab.codeplex.com/) that contains some provider to enable collaboration with Team foundation Server power tools.

A Workspace is a mapping between the server source control system and a local folder of a computer and until Tfs11 its state is managed by the server. One advantage of this approach is: when I ask for a “Get Latest”, the server knows the status of my workspace and can send me only the files that are changed.</description></item><item><title>Convert Brian Keller dev11 Virtual Machine to vmWare</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/09/convert-brian-keller-dev11-virtual-machine-to-vmware/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2011 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/09/convert-brian-keller-dev11-virtual-machine-to-vmware/</guid><description>The Brian Keller’s Virtual Machine with all the goodness of dev11 developer preview is an Hyper-V one, so if you have a windows 7 environment (like me) you cannot use it.

Actually TFS Workspaces status is kept on the server, so whenever you issue a GetLatest, the server check the status of the Workspace and send you only new data.

I found that some people are not aware that such a feature is already there, but is included in TFS power tools, so it is not available out of the box with a plain installation of Visual Studio and TFS.</description></item><item><title>Insert name of the user in assembly file number</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/insert-name-of-the-user-in-assembly-file-number/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2010 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/insert-name-of-the-user-in-assembly-file-number/</guid><description>Assembly file numbering during a Continuous integration build is one of the most interesting feature in a project, but sometimes we need also to generate numbers even for local build, especially if the user can launch some script to do a local compile and use it to deploy somewhere.
Major and Minor number in an assembly file info are usually updated manually when a new version or milestone is reached, so we are left with two 16 bit number to store useful information.</description></item><item><title>Tfs build 2010-create a personalized build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/tfs-build-2010create-a-personalized-build/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2010 17:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/tfs-build-2010create-a-personalized-build/</guid><description>In several posts of the past I dealt with customization of TFS 2010 build, but I never pointed out how to create a personalized build that can be used without always resorting to edit the workflow directly. Suppose you work heavily with database projects, and you need to deploy database project to different server in most of your builds. In this scenario each time you need to deploy a DB project you can create a new build process, edit it, add some customization and finally save and use it for the build.</description></item><item><title>Display complex information in TFS 2010 Build log</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/display-complex-information-in-tfs-2010-build-log/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2010 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/display-complex-information-in-tfs-2010-build-log/</guid><description>If you read this post you learn how to show custom informations in a build, and this is one of the coolest stuff you can do to improve reporting from the buil. In the original example Jason shows how to show informations of a standard object called PlatformConfiguration.
This is very useful if you need to track some custom and complex information during a build from a Custom Action, and you want it to be showed with a specific interface in the log, like a superwarning :) or some information that need to be really evident in the log.</description></item><item><title>Power of the TFS 2010 Build system</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/10/power-of-the-tfs-2010-build-system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2010 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/10/power-of-the-tfs-2010-build-system/</guid><description>Tfs 2010 introduces a lot of news for the Build System, and now Tfs Build it is probably the best choice when you need to setup a Continuous Integration environment for your applications.
One of the most powerful concept is the ability to use multiple Agents, and the use of Workflow Foundation 4.0 as the orchestrator engine for the build. As a result, you can use one of the basic template or you can build a customized one, just creating or modifying the basic workflow.</description></item><item><title>Keep Codeplex projects and local TFS projects syncronized</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/09/keep-codeplex-projects-and-local-tfs-projects-syncronized/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2010 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/09/keep-codeplex-projects-and-local-tfs-projects-syncronized/</guid><description>Codeplex is Microsoft hosting site for open source projects, based on TFS or mercurial. Now suppose you have this scenario: an open source project, with a core team that work actively on it, and some occasional contributors that do little work. Since Codeplex does not support every feature of tfs, (especially you lack the build machine), sharepoint integration and other stuff you loose many useful feature if you use only Codeplex for the project.</description></item><item><title>How to get TFS server address from a local folder mapped to a workspace</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/09/how-to-get-tfs-server-address-from-a-local-folder-mapped-to-a-workspace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2010 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/09/how-to-get-tfs-server-address-from-a-local-folder-mapped-to-a-workspace/</guid><description>Sometimes you need to operate to a Tfs Version Control System with API starting from a local folder. There are a lot of API to work with workspaces, but the main problem is that you need to pass through a VersionControlServer object, and to obtain such an object you need to know the address of the Tfs server the workspace is mapped to?
The exercise is the following one :) – Write a snippet of code, based on TFS API that, given a local path, retrieve ChangesetId that is currently mapped on the workspace.</description></item><item><title>Moving to a deploy system based on Tfs Build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/08/moving-to-a-deploy-system-based-on-tfs-build/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2010 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/08/moving-to-a-deploy-system-based-on-tfs-build/</guid><description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;m able to deploy to a remote machine a web application thanks to a customized build workflow it is time to move to a real scenario.

I do not work with Java, but I want to have a look at it, just to understand the level of integration with TFs.
First impression is really good, because the look and feel of the IDE is really similar to those of Visual Studio, as you can spot from Figure 1 , where I show the connection windows to a local tfs.</description></item><item><title>Deploy remotely with TFS build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/07/deploy-remotely-with-tfs-build/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2010 05:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/07/deploy-remotely-with-tfs-build/</guid><description>It is time to connect together a couple of posts of mine, in the first I simply explained how to deploy a web application to a remote machine with the use of Beyondexec2, in another one I explained how to create a simple tfs build, that actually does not build anything, but execute a simple workflow.

To orchestrate the execution of integration scripts you need an infrastructure that is capable of scheduling, logging, distribution of agent and a central point of manteniance, TFS2010 build system has all this characteristics and many other that makes is suitable to run integration script, not only build one.</description></item></channel></rss>
