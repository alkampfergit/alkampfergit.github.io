&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Basic authorization is now enabled on the communication between the TFS and Search services to make it more secure. Any user installing or upgrading to Update 3 will need to provide a user name / password while configuring Search (and also during Search Service setup in case of remote Search Service).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TFVC shell extension now published as standalone tool</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/03/6959/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Mar 2018 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/03/6959/</guid><description>&lt;p>Finally TFVC shell extension was published as a standalone tool.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This error happens most of the time if you have wrong user credentials in the worker process used by IIS to run the TFS Application.

Clearly you should use HQ or other tools to really pin down the root cause but &lt;strong>most of the time the problem is not enough RAM, or slow disks&lt;/strong>. The second cause can be easily solved moving data to an SSD disk, but giving more RAM to the machine, usually gives more space for OS File cache and can solve even the problem of slow disk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Monitor TFS Search data Usage</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/01/monitor-tfs-search-data-usage/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2018 12:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/01/monitor-tfs-search-data-usage/</guid><description>&lt;p>In previous post I’ve explained how to move searches component in a different machine in a TFS 2018 installation, now it is time to &lt;strong>understand how to monitor that instance.&lt;/strong> First of all you should monitor the folder that physically contains data, in my installation is C:\tfs\ESDATA (it is a parameter you choose when you configure the Search Server with &lt;strong>Configure-TFSSearch.ps1 -Operation install&lt;/strong> PowerShell script). &lt;strong>Data folder should be placed on a fast disk, usually SSD are the best choice&lt;/strong>.

The usual risk is not updating TFS, loosing the update train and then have a problem doing upgrades like TFS 2008 to TFS 2017.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those realities, adopting &lt;strong>VSTS is a huge benefit, no administration costs, no hardware costs, automatic upgrade, accessible from everywhere&lt;/strong> , same licensing (license for VSTS are also valid for TFS) and much more.  Also one of the original limitation, the inability to customize process, is now gone and, for certain aspect, VSTS is superior to the on-premise version (in VSTS you can do less customization but everything is done with Web Interface without needs to edit XML process file)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Decide to publish artifacts on Server or Network Share at queue time</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/decide-to-publish-artifacts-on-server-or-network-share-at-queue-time/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2017 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/decide-to-publish-artifacts-on-server-or-network-share-at-queue-time/</guid><description>&lt;p>A build usually produces artifacts and thanks to the extreme flexibility of VSTS / TFS Build system, you have complete freedom on what to include as artifacts and where you should locate them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Actually you have a couple of options out of the box, a network share or directly on your VSTS / TFS Server. This second option is especially interesting because you does not need a special network share and you do not have permission issue (every script or person that can access the server and have build permission can use the artifacts). &lt;strong>Having everything (build result and artifacts) on the server simplify your architecture&lt;/strong> , but it is not always feasible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hyper-V and Windows AutoLogon</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/hyper-v-and-windows-autologon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2017 19:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/hyper-v-and-windows-autologon/</guid><description>&lt;p>When you configure build agents and especially when you configure Release Agents for VSTS, it is quite normal to have some installations where you want to use AutoLogon. &lt;strong>This is needed whenever you want to run integration tests that needs to interact with the UI.&lt;/strong> Having autologon enabled avoid the need to manually login and start the agent when the machine is rebooted, because you always have a user session opened that runs the agent.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploy test agent and run functional test tasks</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/deploy-test-agent-and-run-functional-test-tasks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2017 19:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/07/deploy-test-agent-and-run-functional-test-tasks/</guid><description>&lt;p>In VSTS / TFS Build there are a couple of tasks that are really useful to execute UAT or Functional tests during a build. &lt;strong>The first one deploy the test agent remotely on a target machine while the second one runs a set of tests on that machine using the agent.&lt;/strong> If you use multiple Run Functional Test task, please &lt;strong>be sure that before each task there is a corresponding Deploy test agent tasks or you will get an error.&lt;/strong> Actually I have a build that run some functional tests, then I’ve added another Run Functional Test task to run a second sets of functional tests.

Here is a sample configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image.png">&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image_thumb.png"> &lt;img src="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/image_thumb.png" alt="Simple image that shows the configuration of a Msbuild Task used to publish a web project." />&lt;/a>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Figure 1&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>: &lt;em>Publishing a web site with msbuild task.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is super simple thanks to MsBuild task and a bit of MSBuild arguments, but quite often I face an annoying problem: &lt;strong>what about a new project that lives only on certain branches, but I need to publish in the build only if exists?&lt;/strong> &amp;gt; &lt;strong>Sometimes you need to execute some task in a build only if a file exists on disk (ex: a csproj file)&lt;/strong> Suppose this new Jarvis.Catalog.Web project exists today in a feature called feature/xyz, then the feature will be closed to develop in the future then will be merged to a release branch and finally on master branch. This poses a problem, &lt;strong>the MsBuild task to publish the web project will fail for every branch where that specific web project still does not exists.&lt;/strong> This is super annoying because you can set the build not to fail if this specific task failed, but this will mistakenly mark all build as partially succeeded only because that project still is not on that branch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use conditional task in VSTS TFS Build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/06/use-conditional-task-in-vsts-tfs-build/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2017 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/06/use-conditional-task-in-vsts-tfs-build/</guid><description>&lt;p>When you start using Continuous Integration extensively, &lt;strong>some builds become complex and sometimes a simple sequence of task is not what you want.&lt;/strong> Previous build system, based on XAML and Workflow Foundation allows you to specify really complex path of execution, but the side effect is that builds become really complex, they are painful to edit and also, you need to use Visual Studio to edit.

The main reason is avoiding any issue with administration or upgrades. In these years, &lt;strong>one of the main risk of having TFS on-premise is not planning for upgrade and keeping the first version installed for years&lt;/strong>. As a result, it is not uncommon to have teams that still uses TFS 2013 even if version 2017 is out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For small teams usually there is not a dedicated TFS administrator; in this situation is it strongly advisable &lt;strong>not to skip one entire major upgrade, to minimize the risk of a big bang upgrade&lt;/strong>. Suppose you have TFS 2015, I strongly suggest you to upgrade to TFS 2017, before another major version is out. This will prevent to have to upgrade 2 or more major version, with the risk of long upgrade times and too many changed that could makes the user upset.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building with agent without Visual Studio installed</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/01/building-with-agent-without-visual-studio-installed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2017 17:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/01/building-with-agent-without-visual-studio-installed/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had a build that runs fine on some agents, then I try running the build on a different agent but the build failed with the error.&lt;/p>

First of all you should &lt;strong>create a&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://docs.nuget.org/create/nuspec-reference">&lt;strong>.nuspec file&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> &lt;strong>that specify everything about your package and include it in your source control&lt;/strong>. Then Add a variable to the build called NugetVersion as shown in &lt;strong>Figure 1.&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image6.png">&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image_thumb6.png"> &lt;img src="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image_thumb6.png" alt="Adding NugetVersion variable to the list of variables for this build." />&lt;/a>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Figure 1&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>: &lt;em>Added NugetVersion variable to build definition.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this build I disabled continuous integration, because I want to publish my package only when I decided that the code is good enough to be published. Publishing to a feed for each build is usually a waste of resources and a nice way to make the history of your package a pain. Since I want to do manual publishing I’ve checked the &lt;strong>“Allow at Queue Time” checkbox, to be able to change Nuget Version Number at queue time.&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Build vNext has a dedicated step called NugetPackager that takes care of creating your package from nuspec file&lt;/strong> , so you do not need to include nuget.exe in your repository or in the server. If you are curious where is nuget.exe stored, you can check installation folder of your build agent, and browse the Task Directory where all the tasks are contained. There you should find the NugetPackager folder where all the script used by the tasks are stored.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resolve associated Work Item at each check-in</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/09/resolve-associated-work-item-at-each-check-in/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Sep 2015 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/09/resolve-associated-work-item-at-each-check-in/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>If you work with TFVC when you Check-in your code, the default action is close associate Work Item&lt;/strong>.

The downside of this approach, is that &lt;strong>every person is able to add whatever tag to work items with the risk of misspelling and duplication&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an example if the team is doing T-Shirt sizing for User Stories, we can have people using tag S to identify a Small Story, then people decides to change to SIZE_S to better indicate the purpose of the tag. Now you have some User Story with S and other one with SIZE_S. Mispelling is another typical problem, even if TFS is suggesting you tags in edit with drop down, there is always the risk that someone write a slightly different tag.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Manage Artifacts with TFS Build vNext</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/06/manage-artifacts-with-tfs-build-vnext/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2015 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/06/manage-artifacts-with-tfs-build-vnext/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="artifacts-and-build-vnext">Artifacts and Build vNext&lt;/h2>

One of the most famous workflow is called &lt;a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">GitFlow&lt;/a>, a way to work in Git that is implemented even in some GUI tool like &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree/overview?_mid=2fbd5293e6446891fb55a371fd05daeb&amp;amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KEQiAkJyjBRClorTki_7Zx8QBEiQAcqwGMVF9nzHt6HSZgIswbcYiWI4InUXsU_25Nq8vajSR7mIaAofw8P8HAQ">SourceTree&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Linking VSO with third party tools</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/10/linking-vso-with-third-party-tools/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2014 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/10/linking-vso-with-third-party-tools/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the most interesting news of VSO in last months &lt;strong>are&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/integrating-with-service-hooks-vs">&lt;strong>service hooks&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> &lt;strong>and REST API to integrate VSO with&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/integrating-with-service-hooks-vs">&lt;strong>third party tools&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>With TFS 2013 a nice new Build template that allow customization with scripts is included and this is my preferred build customization scenario. Now I question myself on &lt;em>How can I pass a password to a script in build definition in a secure way?&lt;/em> When you are on Active Directory, the best solution is using AD authentication. &lt;strong>My build server runs with credentials of user cyberpunk\TfsBuild where cyberpunk is the name of my domain&lt;/strong> and the build is executed with that credentials.

You should have your service installed with a public accessible endpoints, because VSO should be able to call it from Azure. For a simple demo I’ve installed the service on an Azure Virtual Machine but you can use also a Azure Web Site or on-premise IIS that is accessible from azure (have a public DNS).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Application insights installation</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/03/application-insights-installation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2014 12:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/03/application-insights-installation/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve already covered installation of Monitoring Agent for Visual Studio Online Application Insights.

&lt;p>A common question about TFS 2012 build is: &lt;em>how can I ask for code coverage?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The answer is really simple, you should go to the test section of build definition and change the run settings from Default to another setting that includes code coverage and this is really everything you need to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/image_thumb2.png">&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/image_thumb2_thumb.png"> &lt;img src="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/image_thumb2_thumb.png" alt="image_thumb2" />&lt;/a>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Figure 1&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>: &lt;em>Change run settings to enable code coverage&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

One of the reason could be, you started working with an account then your account changes for various reason, so you &lt;strong>need to migrate all workspaces from your old user to another user&lt;/strong>.

&lt;p>tf workspaces /updateUserName:OldUserName /s:sserverurl&lt;/p>
&lt;p>this should be done with your new account, and will assign all workspaces from old account to current account.

Avoiding using hours, gave the idea that we are not estimating precisely, especially because we are interested in team Velocity and not knowing how many hours do we need for a certain task. &lt;strong>For this example suppose our team is used estimating in coc = Cup Of Coffee, and we want the board to reflect this fact&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Git-TF to work with TFS using a local Git repository</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/02/git-tf-to-work-with-tfs-using-a-local-git-repository/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2013 19:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/02/git-tf-to-work-with-tfs-using-a-local-git-repository/</guid><description>&lt;p>Now that TF Service officially supports Git, many people ask themselves if &lt;strong>standard TFS VCS is dead?.

&lt;p>This is a real annoying stuff, because I’m not a Sharepoint Expert, so I started looking around to understand the cause.

Then you need to create an account different from Administration, in my example I created a user named WssService and &lt;em>give a complex password so it met the password complexity rule of the System&lt;/em>. Make this user an administrator of the machine and be sure that it is also an administrator of the SQL Server instance, because he should be able to create databases, be sure also to download &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=26640">Sharepoint 2010 foundation Service Pack 1&lt;/a>, because it will maximize the success rate.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Installing on-premise component against TFS Service TFS On Azure</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/installing-on-premise-component-against-tfs-service-tfs-on-azure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2012 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/installing-on-premise-component-against-tfs-service-tfs-on-azure/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://tfspreview.com/">Tfs on azure&lt;/a> is a a perfectly valid solution to have your &lt;strong>TFS hosted by Microsoft&lt;/strong> , no worries about upgrading, maintaining, backup and most important, &lt;em>it is available from every computer that has an internet connection&lt;/em>.

The Workspace model of TFS was somewhat criticized in the past, because it is logically &lt;em>Server Side&lt;/em>, because TFS Server, in each moment, knows the situation of each workspace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This choice has, (as any choice in real life :) ) good and bad point. The good point is that Get Latest operation are really quick, because the server knows the situation of your workspace and can simply send you all files that were modified since the previous Get operation. The bad part is that, if you delete a file from windows explorer, when you issue a Get Latest it is not downloaded again, because the server really believe that the file is in your workspace (you can solve such inconsistencies with* &lt;strong>tfpt scorch&lt;/strong> *command from &lt;a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c255a1e4-04ba-4f68-8f4e-cd473d6b971f">power tools&lt;/a>). Another annoying problem is that all files are read-only on disk, because before starting a file modification you should contact the server to do a Check-Out operation. This does not mean that the file is locked, just that you need to make the server knows the fact that you started modifying that file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Add existing project to TFS</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/01/add-existing-project-to-tfs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2012 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/01/add-existing-project-to-tfs/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a super basic and easy question, but I found quite often people asking me how to add an existing project to a TFS Team Project.

A Workspace is a mapping between the server source control system and a local folder of a computer and until Tfs11 its state is managed by the server. One advantage of this approach is: when I ask for a “Get Latest”, the server knows the status of my workspace and can send me only the files that are changed. This has some disadvantage, all the files are readonly on disk, because you should explicitly do a “Check-Out” operation to begin editing a file, but there are also some annoying behavior: if you delete a file from the Windows explorer and you issue a Get Latest file, nothings get downloaded, because the server still believes that you have that file on your folder.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Convert Brian Keller dev11 Virtual Machine to vmWare</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/09/convert-brian-keller-dev11-virtual-machine-to-vmware/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2011 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/09/convert-brian-keller-dev11-virtual-machine-to-vmware/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/briankel/archive/2011/09/16/visual-studio-11-application-lifecycle-management-virtual-machine-and-hands-on-labs-demo-scripts.aspx">Brian Keller’s Virtual Machine&lt;/a> with all the goodness of dev11 developer preview is an Hyper-V one, so if you have a windows 7 environment (like me) you cannot use it.

While there is still no DVCS, there are a lot of improvements with the introduction of &lt;em>local workspaces&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Actually TFS Workspaces status is kept on the server, so whenever you issue a GetLatest, the server check the status of the Workspace and send you only new data. This causes sometimes behavior that surprise most developer coming from other VCS like subversion. One of this surprising behavior is &lt;em>delete a file from the file system, then issue a Get Latest, the file is not downloaded again&lt;/em>. This happens because the server does not know that you deleted the file, he still thinks that the file is there so you need to do a Get Specific version, or issue a &lt;a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c255a1e4-04ba-4f68-8f4e-cd473d6b971f">tfpt scorch&lt;/a> command.

&lt;p>Now that we know how to add information to a Work Item definition, it is time to deal with “state” management. Each Work Item has a field called * &lt;strong>Status&lt;/strong> *that is completely different from any other field, because has an associated workflow that manages transactions from various allowed status values. Having a workflow to manage State of a Work Item is a really powerful concept, because permits a more accurate modeling of your process. As an example suppose that in your process each bug enter the system in a status called *&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_triage#Bug_management">Triage&lt;/a>,*because is new and need to be examined by someone before a developer could actually work to its resolution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visual Studio 2010 RTM Virtual Machine Speed up</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/visual-studio-2010-rtm-virtual-machine-speed-up/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2011 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/visual-studio-2010-rtm-virtual-machine-speed-up/</guid><description>&lt;p>I usually use the &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/briankel/archive/2011/05/12/may-2011-refresh-of-visual-studio-2010-rtm-virtual-machine-with-sample-data-and-hands-on-labs.aspx">Brian Keller&amp;rsquo;s RTM Virtual Machine&lt;/a> to do TFS demo in talk or to customers.

&lt;p>In this third part it is time to configure the definition of a Work Item. This is the most complex and more useful section of the process template that you can modify to adapt to your needs.

&lt;p>In the first post I showed how to download the definition of a process template into a local folder and how to open it with the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb980963">Process Template Editor&lt;/a>; in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show you some of the very basic customizations that you can do with the PTE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Methodology section you can simply change the name of the Process Template as well as including a textual description. Remember that if you do not change the name, when you upload the modified version you will overwrite the original PT, so if you are planning to create a modified version of some basic template, you need to change the name first.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Customize TFS Process Template</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/customize-tfs-process-template/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2011 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/customize-tfs-process-template/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the best aspect of TFS is that it is customizable: we can interact with API, customize builds, handle events and many other interaction, but one of the most important is the ability to customize the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718795">process template.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This capability is fundamental, because permit to adapt TFS to own process, the mantra is ** &lt;strong>do not adapt your process to the tool, but adapt the tool to your process&lt;/strong> **. The purpose of an ALM tool is to support your own process, not to force the team to shape itself just to conform to the tool. The ability of a tool to adapt itself to the scenario is the key factor in choosing between various alternative. If you need a wrench you can buy the left one, that works only for a couple of bolt dimension, or you can buy the right one that is adaptable to various bolt&amp;rsquo;s dimension.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tech Ed news for Visual Studio vNext</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/05/tech-ed-news-for-visual-studio-vnext/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2011 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/05/tech-ed-news-for-visual-studio-vnext/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today at Tech Ed Usa &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jasonz/archive/2011/05/16/announcing-alm-roadmap-in-visual-studio-vnext-at-teched.aspx">some of the news&lt;/a> about Visual Studio vNext &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/roadmap?sf1468488=1">were revealed&lt;/a>, I do not want to give you detailed information in my blog, because there are a lot of resources around there and especially you can download a &lt;a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9772730">nice pdf with all the public news&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The question is: &lt;em>Is it possible to have Code Coverage result to be included in drop folder?&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Answering this question is a two phase process, the first one is understanding where MsTest store results of code coverage and verify that is possible to do something useful with them. The answer is simple, you can simply look at the TestResult directory after you execute tests inside visual studio, and you will find a data.coverage file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Installing Tfs with SP1</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/05/installing-tfs-with-sp1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2011 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/05/installing-tfs-with-sp1/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the cool feature of TFS2010 is the separation between &lt;em>installation&lt;/em>and *configuration.*If you need to install a fresh TFS2010 now that SP1 is out, you can simply install tfs, skip the configuration phase and immediately install SP1.

&lt;p>This is probably due to an authentication request, so you can try to open Team Explorer, and if it asks for credential on connecting to TFS this is the reason.

One of the most interesting addition made in SP1 is the support for gated Check In in Eclipse environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all you need to setup a build with ant or maven, and you need to install &lt;a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/2d7c8577-54b8-47ce-82a5-8649f579dcb6">Team Foundation Server Build Extensions Power Tool&lt;/a> on the build server in order to be able to run a build based on Ant.

This needs is especially important for addin like Custom Check-in policies, because if developers do not install check-in policies they would not be run during a Check-in. Every time you show check-in policies to a customer, it immediately ask you how to distribute them to all developers pc automatically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found that some people are not aware that such a feature is already there, but is included in TFS power tools, so it is not available out of the box with a plain installation of Visual Studio and TFS. After installing power tools you can simply right click in the Team Members node and choose Personal Settings&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Insert name of the user in assembly file number</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/insert-name-of-the-user-in-assembly-file-number/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2010 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/insert-name-of-the-user-in-assembly-file-number/</guid><description>&lt;p>Assembly file numbering during a Continuous integration build is one of the most interesting feature in a project, but sometimes we need also to generate numbers even for local build, especially if the user can launch some script to do a local compile and use it to deploy somewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Major and Minor number in an assembly file info are usually updated manually when a new version or milestone is reached, so we are left with two 16 bit number to store useful information.

Suppose you work heavily with database projects, and you need to deploy database project to different server in most of your builds. In this scenario each time you need to deploy a DB project you &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2010/02/25/writing-a-custom-activity-for-tfs-2010-build-workflow/">can create a new build process&lt;/a>, edit it, add some customization and finally save and use it for the build.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Display complex information in TFS 2010 Build log</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/display-complex-information-in-tfs-2010-build-log/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2010 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/display-complex-information-in-tfs-2010-build-log/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you read &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jpricket/archive/2009/12/21/tfs-2010-displaying-custom-build-information-in-visual-studio.aspx">this post&lt;/a> you learn how to show custom informations in a build, and this is one of the coolest stuff you can do to improve reporting from the buil. In the original example Jason shows how to show informations of a standard object called PlatformConfiguration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is very useful if you need to track some custom and complex information during a build from a Custom Action, and you want it to be showed with a specific interface in the log, like a superwarning :) or some information that need to be really evident in the log.

&lt;p>One of the most powerful concept is the ability to use multiple Agents, and the use of Workflow Foundation 4.0 as the orchestrator engine for the build. As a result, you can use one of the basic template or you can build a customized one, just creating or modifying the basic workflow. Just to show the degree of customization you can reach, &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jimlamb/archive/2010/09/14/parallelized-builds-with-tfs2010.aspx">this article&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jimlamb/">Jim Lamb&lt;/a> shows you a customized build workflow that parallelize the build by Platform/configuration among the various available agents.

Now suppose you have this scenario: an open source project, with a  core team that work actively on it, and some occasional contributors that do little work. Since Codeplex does not support every feature of tfs, (especially you lack the build machine), sharepoint integration and other stuff you loose many useful feature if you use only Codeplex for the project. You wish the core team to use an internal TFS to have the full power of TFS, while using Codeplex to make the project available to everyone.

There are a lot of API to work with workspaces, but the main problem is that you need to pass through a &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb171724%28v=VS.100%29.aspx">VersionControlServer&lt;/a> object, and to obtain such an object you need to know the address of the Tfs server the workspace is mapped to?&lt;/p>

&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Now I want to move to a real scenario:&lt;em>executing the deploy when build quality of a specific build changes to &lt;em>ready for deployment&lt;/em>.&lt;/em> To accomplish this task you first need to understand how to register for event subscription in TFS, thanks to the &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc507647.aspx">bisubscribe.exe&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> tool.

&lt;p>In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll cover a primitive build workflow to deploy the result of another build. The starting point is having a build called &lt;em>Demo&lt;/em> that builds a web site and create the installer package, plus the script described &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2010/07/06/deploy-on-remote-machine-during-builds/">here&lt;/a>. You need to insert the scripts and the PsExec utility in the source code of your team project, to be available from the build agent during the build, as shown in &lt;strong>Figure 1&lt;/strong>. Note: in this example I&amp;rsquo;ll use the &lt;a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx">PsExec&lt;/a> tools instead of beyondexecv2, but they are exactly equivalent, PsExex is more maintained tool and works better when execute in services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use TFS 2010 build to execute arbitrary task</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/07/use-tfs-2010-build-to-execute-arbitrary-task/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2010 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/07/use-tfs-2010-build-to-execute-arbitrary-task/</guid><description>&lt;p>When you deal with continuous integration, building source is just one part of the problem, you need to run test, calculate metrics, deploy on test server and so on.
