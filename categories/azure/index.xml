If you have the need to create a standard VM, both Linux or Windows, you probably want an access with SSH or RDP to configure and manage it and using a public address is probably the quickest, but less secure way, to do it.</description></item><item><title>Application insight real life avoid sending garbage to AI instance</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2019/03/application-insight-real-life-avoid-sending-garbage-to-ai-instance/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2019 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2019/03/application-insight-real-life-avoid-sending-garbage-to-ai-instance/</guid><description>Application Insight is a real nice azure service that allows you to instrument your application to have a complete set of telemetries and problem diagnostics. Usually when you start using Application Insight, you also have some log in place (log4net, serilog) and you want to integrate logs with AI so some kind of logs (Ex errors) will be automatically send to AI.
All these log libraries allows you to write a sink / appender to send logs to your chosen destination, thus, sending all your serilog / log4net logs to application insight is usually a matter of minutes.</description></item><item><title>Use the right Azure Service Endpoint in build vNext</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/12/use-the-right-azure-service-endpoint-in-build-vnext/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2015 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/12/use-the-right-azure-service-endpoint-in-build-vnext/</guid><description>Build vNext has a task dedicated to uploading files in azure blob , as you can see from Figure 1: Figure 1: Azure File Copy task configured in a vNext build
The nice parte is the Azure Subscription setting, that allows to choose one of the Azure endpoint configured for the project. Using service endpoint, you can ask to the person that has password/keys for Azure Account to configure an endpoint.</description></item><item><title>Where is my Azure VM using Azure CLI</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/10/where-is-my-azure-vm-using-azure-cli/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2015 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/10/where-is-my-azure-vm-using-azure-cli/</guid><description>Azure command line interface, known as Azure CLI is a set of open source, cross platform commands to manage your Azure resources. The most interesting aspect of these tools is that they are Cross Platform and you can use them even on Linux boxex.
After you imported your certificate key to manage your azure account you can issue a simple command
1 azure vm list To simply list all of your VM of your account.</description></item><item><title>Where is my DNS name for Azure VM with new Resource manager</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/10/where-is-my-dns-name-for-azure-vm-with-new-resource-manager/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2015 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/10/where-is-my-dns-name-for-azure-vm-with-new-resource-manager/</guid><description>Azure is changing management mode for resources, as you can read from this article and this is the reason why, in the new portal, you can see two different entry for some of the resources, ex: Virtual Machines.
Figure 1: Classic and new resource management in action
Since the new model has more control over resources, I’ve create a linux machine with the new model to do some testing. After the machine was created I opened the blade for the machine (machine create with the new model are visible only on the new portal) and I noticed that I have no DNS name setting.</description></item></channel></rss>
