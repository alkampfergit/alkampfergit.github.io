The &lt;strong>more freedom&lt;/strong> given to the model, the &lt;strong>more the result can deviate&lt;/strong> from your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Using a model to help write detailed specifications is an easy way to accomplish this.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This allows you to quickly generate good, detailed specs that you can manually refine. I often use various models with Open Web UI for this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that Claude Code offers agents, and creating an agent is simple, I immediately &lt;strong>tried creating agents to automate this process.&lt;/strong> The results are promising, but not perfect. &lt;strong>Claude Code seems focused on writing code and tends to over-deliver.&lt;/strong> Starting with a simple idea and asking Claude Code to create an agent for brainstorming detailed specifications yields good results, but how good are they?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Call o3-pro in Azure OpenAI using C# SDK</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/ai/call-o3-pro-with-csharp-sdk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/ai/call-o3-pro-with-csharp-sdk/</guid><description>&lt;p>Azure OpenAI supports now o3-pro model. This model is different from other ones, here is a brief summary of its advantages: &lt;em>The o3-pro model excels at advanced reasoning, delivers high accuracy, supports long-context tasks, and integrates powerful tools like web search and code execution. Itâ€™s cost-effective, reliable, and ideal for complex workflows in research, business, and creative fields.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find tons of example on how you can call Azure OpenAI models with C# Nuget Package but &lt;strong>o3-pro is a slightly different beast&lt;/strong>. The usual problem is you will use existing code and you got this error.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GitHub Copilot Workspace: first impression</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/ai/gh-copilot-workspace-first-impression/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/ai/gh-copilot-workspace-first-impression/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have the luck to have enabled the technical preview of &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2024-04-29-github-copilot-workspace/">Github Copilot Workspace&lt;/a>. As every good developer, I immediately jump at it, without reading anything (spoiler you have a good &lt;a href="https://github.com/githubnext/copilot-workspace-user-manual">user manual&lt;/a>) that can be used to &lt;strong>move your first steps into this marvelous world&lt;/strong>. Not reading the documentation is for me a good way to start using it and verify &lt;strong>how intuitive is the tool and what it can do into a real project&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introductory video playlist about Semantic Kernel RC</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/ai/introduction-to-semantic-kernel-rc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/ai/introduction-to-semantic-kernel-rc/</guid><description>&lt;p>Semantic Kernel reached Release Candidate and there are some breaking changes from the latest beta.

In previous example I demonstrated how you can decompose a complex operation in multiple steps, actually guiding Copilot towards desired result.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Now the question is: Once you got it right, is it possible to use a single prompt to have desired result?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well the answer is &lt;strong>it depends&lt;/strong>. It is not simple because the AI needs to perform an intermediate series of steps and the result can:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GitHub Copilot-X in action: generation of test object with random data</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/copilot-x-few-shot-prompt/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/copilot-x-few-shot-prompt/</guid><description>&lt;p>In real world software you often have complex classes, in this situation we have &lt;strong>AtomicReadmodels in a project heavily based on Event Sourcing&lt;/strong>. One challenge they present is the presence of only private setters for all properties - a necessity due to the unconventional nature of these classes, &lt;strong>which rely on parsing domain events for property population&lt;/strong>. This results in difficulties when creating test classes in memory during unit testing, as the private setters block external code from setting properties. Reflection or usage of libraries such as &lt;strong>Fasterflect are usually the solution but not without any annoyances&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unleashing the Power of Copilot in Visual Studio for Exception Handling</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/unleashing-the-power-of-copilot-in-visual-studio-for-exception-handling.md/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/unleashing-the-power-of-copilot-in-visual-studio-for-exception-handling.md/</guid><description>&lt;p>While running a program, when an exception occurs, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s easy to figure out what caused it. Other times, it can be more complex, &lt;strong>especially in the case of unique exceptions you might not be familiar with&lt;/strong>. Here, having Copilot chat inside Visual Studio offers an extra gear. Within the exception menu, we now have an option that allows us to ask Copilot for information on that specific exception.&lt;/p>
