&lt;p>This is a problem that happens to some person recently and today was my turn.

This is a great news especially because the Dll are finally redistributable, and your tool does not need to require a previous installation of Visual Studio or Team Explorer, or Client Object Model Package.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another interesting fact, is that &lt;strong>REST API are now supported for TFS 2015 / VSO&lt;/strong> (previous version of TFS does not support REST API). If you have traditional application that uses Client Object Model, you can remove all the references to the old dll and directly reference the &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TeamFoundationServer.ExtendedClient/">ExtendedClient Package&lt;/a> and you are ready to go.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unable to debug dll source code with symbol server</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/06/unable-to-debug-dll-source-code-with-symbol-server/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2015 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/06/unable-to-debug-dll-source-code-with-symbol-server/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve blogged in the past about using a &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2013/07/04/manage-symbol-server-on-azure-or-on-premise-vm-and-tf-service/">Symbol server&lt;/a> and I &lt;strong>recommend to all people to use symbol servers whenever possible&lt;/strong> , to helping people troubleshooting problem on dependencies. Basically with a symbol server you can reference a dll in your project, but you can debug original source code as if you have the original project linked instead of having the dll.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes this process just don’t work. Recently I’have a customer that had problem with this scenario, and the real strange stuff is: I’m able to step in dll source code without problem from any machine, but noone of the customer’s developers are able to make it work.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>First:&lt;/strong> &lt;em>you need to be aware that &lt;strong>Remote Debugging Managed Code&lt;/strong> is only available when you use the authenticated mode, if you run the remote debugger without authentication you can &lt;strong>debug only Native Code&lt;/strong> , but the main problem is that usually &lt;em>the host and remote machine&lt;/em> * &lt;strong>are not&lt;/strong> in the same Domain&lt;/em>. To bypass this situation you need to create what is called “Shadow Account”, this means that you need to have in * &lt;strong>both machines the same user with the same password.&lt;/strong> *&lt;/li>

&lt;p>There are a lot of reasons to group files togheter, you can use this technique for group partial classes definition or you can simply want to group logically related files, etc etc. The annoying stuff is that there is no menu in Visual Studio that permits you to obtain this result, but you can solve everything with a  macro.

&lt;p>A simple and stupid solution is to attach to every w3wp.exe processes that is actually running in the system :), it is somewhat a &lt;em>patch&lt;/em> solution, but it is really easy to implement, because it requires only a minor modification of the code generated by the Macro Recorder.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visual Studio Macro-Attach To Local IIS</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/08/visual-studio-macroattach-to-local-iis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2011 14:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/08/visual-studio-macroattach-to-local-iis/</guid><description>&lt;p>As I &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2011/04/07/visual-studio-macro-to-the-rescue/">stated previously&lt;/a>, the capability of Visual Studio to use Macro is probably one of the less known feature and one of the coolest.

The DatabaseSchemaProviderCompatibility permits you to specify the version of the database the rule applies to, in my example a standard sqlDatabase, then the DataRuleAttirbute is used to specify name, id, description, and other attributes of the rule.

&lt;p>As you can see, when I try to add an Hyper-V enabled machine (The same where SCVMM is running) it tells me that virtualization software is Unknown, even if hyper-V is up and running fine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Database Edition Custom Rule</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/11/database-edition-custom-rule/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2009 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/11/database-edition-custom-rule/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the coolest feature of Visual Studio Database Edition is the ability to run Rules against a database project, like fxcop against a c# project. And the coolest part about this feature is that is really simple to write a custom rule.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rules are important, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen project where there is no naming rule for objects in database, and so you will end with tables with column like, ablr_xxxx or xxxxx_xxx_Authorname etc etc, and the whole database looses consistency over time. Thanks to database edition I can create a custom rule that &lt;strong>force&lt;/strong> all developers to use for example a standard naming scheme for the column.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vsdbcmdexe overriding variable value</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/11/vsdbcmd-exe-overriding-variable-value/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Nov 2009 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/11/vsdbcmd-exe-overriding-variable-value/</guid><description>&lt;p>When you deploy a database project with the command line utility &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd193283.aspx">vsdbcmd.exe&lt;/a> you may want to change the value of some variables of the project.

&lt;p>Now you want to decide at deploy time the physical location of your database. The main problem is that vsdbcmd.exe takes deploy variable from the Database.sqlcmdvars file, so if you want to change a value of a variable you have two options. The first is using some xpath knowledge to change the value in the Database.sqlcmdvars, since it is a simple xml file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Dude for Visual Studio 2010</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/11/data-dude-for-visual-studio-2010/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2009 17:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/11/data-dude-for-visual-studio-2010/</guid><description>&lt;p>For those out there that are, like me, fans of Data Dude, here is a &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vstsdb/archive/2009/10/19/what-s-new-for-data-dude-in-visual-studio-2010.aspx">link&lt;/a> that shows you the news about Data Dude in VS2010.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most appealing part is that &lt;em>database projects&lt;/em> are now supported starting from VS professional edition, so I&amp;rsquo;m expecting that more and more people will try to manage databases with Visual Studio. Clearly most of the features are still available only for VS Premium or VS Ultimate users, but at least, people with professional can compile a DB Project, Execute unit testing or data generation plan (but only people with Premium and Ultimate are able to create and manage them).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Driven Test of a stored procedure in Database Edition</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/11/data-driven-test-of-a-stored-procedure-in-database-edition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2009 17:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/11/data-driven-test-of-a-stored-procedure-in-database-edition/</guid><description>&lt;p>Database Tests are really a great feature of Database Edition, and, like other tests, you can create a Data Driven Test of a stored procedure with little effort. The first stuff I do is to create a database project that will contains a table for each sets of data I want to use in a test.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/image14.png">&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/image_thumb14.png"> &lt;img src="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/image_thumb14.png" alt="image" />&lt;/a>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this project I create a table for each sets of data, and create a script to preload the data as post-deployment script. In this example I want to test a stored procedure, that accepts a string filter, and for each filter I want to test the number of rows returned. To achieve this I need a set of test data with two column, a filter column and a ExpectedNumberOfResult column. I create this table in the TestDatabase Database project&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coded Ui Test in VS 2010</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/coded-ui-test-in-vs-2010/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2009 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/coded-ui-test-in-vs-2010/</guid><description>&lt;p>I must admit that I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely not a fan of testing through UI.

&lt;p>Another point of interest is that Data Dude is installed with TFS build agent, so you do not need to devote one license to the machine where the build agent runs, and this is great.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mvp Team System</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/mvp-team-system/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2009 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/mvp-team-system/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve already announced on my Italian blog, yesterday I received the communication from Microsoft that I awarded a MVP in Team System category.

&lt;p>To speedup database testing the best solution is to test database in memory, but with sql server it can be difficult&amp;hellip;or not? With a simple software that create a RAMDisk, (a disk made of ram like &lt;a href="http://www.dataram.com/">Dataram&lt;/a> one), you are able to create RAMDisk with few clicks and have a disk that actually runs at memory speed.
