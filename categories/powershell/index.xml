This means that if you end your function with return $something you would not get only the content of the variable $something but every output that you did in the function.
For this reason you need to be super careful not to use Write-Output, because all the output will be included in the returned value.</description></item><item><title>Pills: Invoke-WebRequest really Slow</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/azdo/pills/powershell-download/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2020 22:12:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/azdo/pills/powershell-download/</guid><description>There are times when using Invoke-WebRequest in PowerShell is really slow, especially compared to a direct download in a browser. The answer is as always on StackOverflow in this post but for some reason approved answer is not my favorite.
Approved solution uses WebClient, it is perfectly valid, but other answer are more correct (and have more votes). In my opinion the real solution is disabling progress.
$ProgressPreference = &amp;#39;SilentlyContinue&amp;#39; This usually is enough to speedup Invoke-WebRequest without changing every single call to use WebClient.</description></item></channel></rss>
