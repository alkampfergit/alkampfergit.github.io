&lt;p>Since Lab Management is really a complex set of tools, even if it is in the iso images of TFS 2010 is still considered to be in &lt;em>release candidate&lt;/em> version. Now we can announce two big news&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>RTM Bits will be released at the end of August&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lab managements will be avaliable even in MSDN Ultimate or TestProfessional with MSDN&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The second news is very well welcomed, because it widen the number of people that could benefit from Lab Management.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploy a solution and a database in a Lab Management Virtual Environment</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/06/deploy-a-solution-and-a-database-in-a-lab-management-virtual-environment/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2010 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/06/deploy-a-solution-and-a-database-in-a-lab-management-virtual-environment/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the coolest feature of Tfs2010 is Lab Management, an infrastructure tool that permits you to manage Virtual Environment to test your applications. Once you have defined some &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2010/04/12/preparing-template-machine-for-lab-management/">template machine&lt;/a> in SCVMM you can import them into your Lab to be used in defining Virtual Environment.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When you imported all the templates you need from SCVMM, to create a new environment you simply need to go to &lt;em>Environment&lt;/em> tab, and create new virtual environment, then you can choose VM template to compose a test environment, like in the following picture where I choose three machine, a web server, a db server and a client machine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lab management TF267042 and dns configuration</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/06/lab-management-tf267042-and-dns-configuration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2010 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/06/lab-management-tf267042-and-dns-configuration/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I configured an environment in lab management, when it finishes the deploy phase I see that the machine has testing capabilities &lt;em>Error&lt;/em> and the details of the error is&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The following host is unusable for Lab Management: xxxx in host group: &amp;ldquo;All Hosts&amp;rdquo;. To make it usable, connect at least one of its physical network adapters to a valid network. Then, verify the host group again to ensure that the problem has been resolved.&lt;/strong> *&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is due to the fact that you are configuring everything in a single box, and lab management complains that he need a physical network to communicate with the host group. Thankfully the Lab Management Blog as a &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lab_management/archive/2010/02/08/configuring-network-location-for-vs-lab-management-2010-rc-one-box-setup.aspx">dedicated post&lt;/a> on how to solve the problem, just follow the instructions and run&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Preparing template machine for Lab Management</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/04/preparing-template-machine-for-lab-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2010 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/04/preparing-template-machine-for-lab-management/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quite often, customers ask for web application to be fully compatible with IE6 IE7 and IE8, so you need to always have some virtual machine with all version of IE running somewhere. In such a scenario, having right template machine in Lab Management can be a good option, so I decided to try it out and create some template machine to use in this scenario.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all I created a simple virtual machine in hyper-v, install WindowsXP SP3, and did all the update, except Internet explorer, so my system is fully updated with latest patch but with IE6.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scvmm could not reset local administrator password during template creation</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/03/scvmm-could-not-reset-local-administrator-password-during-template-creation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Mar 2010 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/03/scvmm-could-not-reset-local-administrator-password-during-template-creation/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m creating some template in SCVMM to be used with lab management, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a windows XP client machine, joined to the domain, installed and configured Test Agent and finally I used SCVMM to convert the machine to a template.&lt;/p>
