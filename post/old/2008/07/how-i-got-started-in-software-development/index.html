I really loved basic at these times :D.</p><p><strong>How did you get started in programming?</strong> I simply turned on Vic 20, ran some games loaded from tape (yuck……it seems strange for me that music tape could contain games :D ) and then I began to read manuals..I found that I can program the computer, not only play with it, it was so exiting that I begin to study basic. When I grew older I decided that programming is really a funny thing, so it would be beautiful to make it my primary profession…..here I am :D</p><p><strong>What was your first language?</strong> Basic, like most people that started to play programming in the early ’80.</p><p><strong>What was the first real program you wrote?</strong> My first real program that did some real thing was a kind of “marrying agency” I wrote while I was a student. The program was written in turbo pascal 4.0, you entered some information about you (birthdate, things you like etc), the program save these information on disk (No RDBMS, just a custom record structure) and then try to find a match with other people in database, looking for astrological affinity, interest affinity…it was a really funny thing, because the first run was done with all my school friends :D.</p><p>The first program I did for profession was during university, written in Visual Basic 6, It was a tool to manage data for some historical buildings, I need to store information, images, and produce a txt file with weird format, that has to be sent to a national central database :D.</p><p><strong>What languages have you used since you started programming?</strong> I started with Basic, then turbo pascal, fortran and a little bit of Cobol. Last year of high school I played with prolog then shift to C/C++ and assembly language (Mainly x86 family and some specific architecture like Playstation2 and some MIPS, then Visual Basic 5.0 and 6.0, and finally.NET environment (MSIL, Visual Basic.NET, c# and a little bit of Boo). When I was at university I used VHDL to create a simulation of a vertex and pixel shader).</p><p><strong>What was your first professional programming gig?</strong> When I was at university I begin a collaboration with an engineer that committed to our group some programs, we worked mainly on software for engineering companies.</p><p><strong>If you knew then what you know now, would you have started programming?</strong> Absolutely :D, I really like this work, maybe I would have choose different area, like videgames or 3d computer graphics.</p><p><strong>If there is one thing you learned along the way that you would tell new developers, what would it be?</strong> Always strive yourself to learn something new, never stop to read articles, books, blogs, etc. Think that code you wrote yesterday could be written better tomorrow.</p><p><strong>What’s the most fun you’ve ever had … programming?</strong> It is difficult to answer, maybe Seeing the first textured cube on playstation2, I can rotate with controller, it was really a good sensation. Another interesting thing was fotogrammetry, we worked a lot of time ago on a custom algorithm, it was really a great sensation to scan two picture and see our program that draw the wireframe of the box to the screen. Then I really love community, making presentation, and sharing knowledge with other.</p><p>Who do I tag?</p><p>mmmmmmmm I can tag <a href=http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/ste8/Default.aspx>Stefano Ottaviani</a>, a friend of DotnetMarche…hey ste….it is your turn :D</p><p>alk.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><div class="container sep-before"><div class=categories><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M22 19a2 2 0 01-2 2H4a2 2 0 01-2-2V5A2 2 0 014 3H9l2 3h9a2 2 0 012 2z"/></svg><span class=screen-reader-text>Categories: </span><a class=category href=/categories/general/>general</a></div><div class=tags><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2H12l8.59 8.59A2 2 0 0120.59 13.41z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=screen-reader-text>Tags: </span><a class=tag href=/tags/general/>General</a></div></div></footer></article><nav class=entry-nav><div class=container><div class="prev-entry sep-before">Leave comment in GitHub discussion page<a target=_blank href=https://github.com/alkampfergit/personal-blog/discussions> alkampfergit/personal-blog/discussions</a></div><div class="prev-entry sep-before"><a href=/post/old/2008/07/run-test-code-often/><span aria-hidden=true><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><line x1="20" y1="12" x2="4" y2="12"/><polyline points="10 18 4 12 10 6"/></svg>Previous</span>
