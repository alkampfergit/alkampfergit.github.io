One of the thing I really do not like is the lack of information on design time data. Since I really develop every XAML application with MVVM or MVVM like approach, I always have design time data and Iâ€™d like Visual Studio to be able to use it during binding operation.</description></item><item><title>WPF binding a text with decoration</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/04/wpf-binding-a-text-with-decoration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2011 13:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/04/wpf-binding-a-text-with-decoration/</guid><description>Suppose you need to show some decorated text in a MVVM WPF application, something like
2, 9 , 16 Dicembre 2011
And all the decorations are inserted by some business logic, for example bold if a value is greater than X, strikethrough if the value is less than Y, or similar logic.

The solution is to write a custom IValueConverter that convert from the enum to a valid resource file, but we need to pay specific attention. In WPF you can include images as resources in a very simple way, just include the images in the project and set the build Action to Resource, as shown in Figure 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
