Actually a Pull Requests introduce this enormous advantage in a team&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You know when a feature/bugfix branch is ready to be inspected by the team&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A single place of discussion&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automatic Merge and tests run on merge result&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Actually you have a lots of other advantages, but I want to &lt;strong>concentrate the attention on test run&lt;/strong>. A good and healthy project contains Tests: Unit, Integration, Ui, etc, and usually after years running the entire suite is time consuming. &lt;strong>This lead to an antipattern, where developers does not run all the tests before committing&lt;/strong>, but usually runs only a subset of tests, to verify new code.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
