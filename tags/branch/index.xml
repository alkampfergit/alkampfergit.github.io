One of the most missed feature is a correct use of a branch. Let&amp;rsquo;s make a concrete example. Suppose that developer A needs to implement a big feature, it estimates a week to complete it, and while he is working at this feature he needs also to modify some basic part of the system.</description></item></channel></rss>
