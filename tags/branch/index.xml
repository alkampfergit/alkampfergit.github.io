I must admit that I do not like that tool too, but this is not related to TFS, because conflicts resolution is an operation that must be done by people locally.
For those people, like me, that work a lot with subversion, probably winmerge is the right tool to resolve merge conflicts, and it is really simple to instruct Visual Studio to use winmerge instead of the standard tool to merge two files.</description></item></channel></rss>
