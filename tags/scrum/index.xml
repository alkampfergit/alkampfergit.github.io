In this scenario the major problem is &lt;strong>how to evaluate some new “stuff”, while not losing money and, most important, how to understand if the new “stuff” is really better than the old one&lt;/strong> so it worth continue spending time on it and not moving on other newer “stuff”.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Risk of not being agile</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/06/risk-of-not-being-agile/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/06/risk-of-not-being-agile/</guid><description>&lt;p>Deciding if it worth change own process towards agile ones, es &lt;a href="http://www.scrum.org">Scrum&lt;/a>, should be done not only estimating the advantage of using the new process, but also &lt;em>estimating the risk of not using agile procedures developing software in these days&lt;/em>.

&lt;p>A project started with a set of requirements approved by the stakeholder, after initial basic features were implemented, developers started to work on an “advanced search functionality” requirement, that had * &lt;strong>quite technical difficulties and took quite a bit of time to develop&lt;/strong> *. The result was good, it worked as requested and used some really advanced functionality for the time it was build.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
