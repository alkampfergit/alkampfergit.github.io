Using Fiddler I discovered that I got an error calling xmlrpc.php. I’ve opened a ticket on my blog hosting, and the support told me that access to xmlrpc.php was blocked on that machine (my blog is on a shared host) because of spam attack.
The problem is, malicious script try continuously to send spam content to WordPress blogs using standard API and this usually causes a spike in CPU usage.</description></item><item><title>Cleaning up your WSUS Server</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/08/cleaning-up-your-wsus-server/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/08/cleaning-up-your-wsus-server/</guid><description>The situation I’ve a WSUS server that is up and running for last 2 years, it runs on a HP Proliant Microserver where I have a domain controller for my test lab.

This week I moved a couple of SSD to that server, because it will be used for virtualization, and I did noticed that my Vertex 4 is performing really slower respect the original system, so I immediately checked and verified that I forgot to enable AHCI in the BIOS.</description></item><item><title>Really impressed by AspNix web hosting</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/08/really-impressed-by-aspnix-web-hosting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2013 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/08/really-impressed-by-aspnix-web-hosting/</guid><description>I needed to move my blog on another hosting quickly, and I was puzzled on what hosting to choose.
