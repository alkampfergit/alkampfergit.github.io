&lt;p>I have a really similar identical setup on another computer, where the user is admin of the machine and everythign work. I’ve found some solution on the internet, but nothing worked, until I found some clue on the fact that, this error is somewhat related to google store.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rename xmlrpcphp on your WordPress installation</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/12/rename-xmlrpc-php-on-your-wordpress-installation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2015 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/12/rename-xmlrpc-php-on-your-wordpress-installation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last month my Live Writer stopped being able to publish on this blog. Using Fiddler I discovered that I got an error calling xmlrpc.php. I’ve opened a ticket on my blog hosting, and the support told me that &lt;strong>access to xmlrpc.php was blocked on that machine (my blog is on a shared host) because of spam attack&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem is, malicious script try continuously to send spam content to WordPress blogs using standard API and this usually causes a spike in CPU usage. For this reason many providers block access to xmlrpc.php file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cleaning up your WSUS Server</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/08/cleaning-up-your-wsus-server/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/08/cleaning-up-your-wsus-server/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-situation">The situation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’ve a WSUS server that is up and running for last 2 years, it runs on a HP Proliant Microserver where I have a domain controller for my test lab. The purpose of WSUS Server is reducing download time for updates when I install test VMs. I’ve lots of Test VM, and the time needed to download updates is really great, so I’ve decided to configure a WSUS server to mitigate that problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Windows Server 2012 R2 switching to AHCI after installation</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/08/windows-server-2012-r2-switching-to-ahci-after-installation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2014 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/08/windows-server-2012-r2-switching-to-ahci-after-installation/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve installed some weeks ago a new server, and at the time of installation I did the really bad error of not fully checking BIOS settings. This week I moved a couple of SSD to that server, because it will be used for virtualization, and I did noticed that my Vertex 4 is performing really slower respect the original system, so I immediately checked and verified that &lt;strong>I forgot to enable AHCI in the BIOS&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Really impressed by AspNix web hosting</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/08/really-impressed-by-aspnix-web-hosting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2013 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/08/really-impressed-by-aspnix-web-hosting/</guid><description>&lt;p>I needed to move my blog on another hosting quickly, and I was puzzled on what hosting to choose. Since I had no much time to evaluate a series of alternative, I asked to some friends for an &lt;strong>hosting that have monthly billing and they directed me towards&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://aspnix.com/">&lt;strong>aspnix&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. Since I had no time to evaluate alternatives my plan was to move the blog on a cheap monthly plan then evaluate alternatives. I choose  the &lt;a href="https://aspnix.com/web-hosting/windows-starter-hosting/">Windows Starter Web Hosting&lt;/a>, it costs $3.00 at each month but I had also a discount coupon so I paid $2.20 for each month.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running Three monitors with single video card</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/04/running-three-monitors-with-single-video-card/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2013 03:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/04/running-three-monitors-with-single-video-card/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m a great fan of Three Monitors configuration and I usually have two video cards with a Motherboard that support two PCI Express 16x. This configuration is not the top, unless you really need to have super high video performance using the two Video Card in Crossfire configuration. I’ve also the following problems&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My Motherboard has two Pci Express physically 16x, but the second one is only 4x electrically, and when I use software like snagit, the overall experience is not so smooty.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Old windows update window in Windows 8</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/03/old-windows-update-window-in-windows-8/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2013 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/03/old-windows-update-window-in-windows-8/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve moved all of my computers to &lt;em>Windows 8&lt;/em> (I’ve used it in my laptop since the beta but the workstation was still in windows 7) and I’m really satisfied with this choice. The only drawback is that you need to find &lt;strong>how to do some old stuff in the old way if you do not like the new way :)&lt;/strong>. I usually do not enable automatic update in Windows, I want only to be notified when updates are available then I proceed to install manually and I’m really used to&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
