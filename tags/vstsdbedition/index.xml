This turns to be a quite good system, but it requires manteniance, since every time you change the database you also need to change sql file to recreate the new structure to run tests.
My goal is to fully automate this process, avoiding manual intervention and running everything in a standard NUNIT project, and make test runnable even from programmer that does not have visual studio database edition installed.</description></item><item><title>Installing Visual Studio Team System 2008 Database Edition GDR R2</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/installing-visual-studio-team-system-2008-database-edition-gdr-r2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2009 01:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/installing-visual-studio-team-system-2008-database-edition-gdr-r2/</guid><description>Today I need to install VSDB edition GDR into a older virtual machine, I just fired the installer and got this error.
