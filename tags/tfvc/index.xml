VS2015 has an option for you in Settings pane of the Visual Studio Team Foundation Server Source Control to change this default behavior to associate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see in &lt;strong>Figure 1&lt;/strong> the default value is to &lt;em>Resolve associated Work Items on check-in&lt;/em> but you can easily uncheck the option to make “*Associate”*the default action for Work Items associated to a Check-in.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unable to create workspace after TFS upgrade a workspace already exists</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/02/unable-to-create-workspace-after-tfs-upgrade-a-workspace-already-exists/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2015 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/02/unable-to-create-workspace-after-tfs-upgrade-a-workspace-already-exists/</guid><description>&lt;p>At a customer site we performed an upgrade from TFS 2010 to TFS 2013, &lt;strong>moving from a computer in Workspace to a computer in Domain&lt;/strong>. With this operation we finally &lt;strong>defined a DNS name for tfs so all user can access it from tfs.company.local name, instead of using machine name&lt;/strong>. After we performed the upgrade, all the user were warned of this change and we simply told them to recreate workspaces pointing to the new server.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
