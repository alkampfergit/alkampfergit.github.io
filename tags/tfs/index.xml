&lt;p>One of the most waited feature for the on-premise version is the ability to change work item Type and to move work item between project, a feature present in Azure DevOps Server, but that needs a complete disable of Reporting Services to work, as I discussed &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2018/12/16/tfs-2019-change-work-item-type-and-move-between-team-project/">in an old Post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TFS 2018 Update 3 is out what changes for Search</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/09/tfs-2018-update-3-is-out-what-changes-for-search/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2018 19:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/09/tfs-2018-update-3-is-out-what-changes-for-search/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/tfs2018-update3">TFS 2018 Update 3 is finally out&lt;/a> and in release notes there is a nice news for Search functionality, &lt;strong>basic security now enforced through a custom plugin&lt;/strong>.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Basic authorization is now enabled on the communication between the TFS and Search services to make it more secure.

The second cause can be easily solved moving data to an SSD disk, but giving more RAM to the machine, usually gives more space for OS File cache and can solve even the problem of slow disk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TFS 2018 search components in different server</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/01/tfs-2018-search-components-in-different-server/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2018 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/01/tfs-2018-search-components-in-different-server/</guid><description>&lt;p>When it is time to design topology of a TFS installation, for small team the &lt;strong>single server is usually the best choice in term of licensing (one one Windows Server license is  needed) and simplicity of maintenance.&lt;/strong> Traditionally the only problem that can occur is: some component (especially the Analysis and Reporting services) starts to slow down the machine if the amount of data starts to become consistent.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Actually you have a couple of options out of the box, a network share or directly on your VSTS / TFS Server. This second option is especially interesting because you does not need a special network share and you do not have permission issue (every script or person that can access the server and have build permission can use the artifacts). &lt;strong>Having everything (build result and artifacts) on the server simplify your architecture&lt;/strong> , but it is not always feasible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Development and Related Work missing on new UI form after upgrade to TFS 2017</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/04/development-and-related-work-missing-on-new-ui-form-after-upgrade-to-tfs-2017/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2017 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/04/development-and-related-work-missing-on-new-ui-form-after-upgrade-to-tfs-2017/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve dealt on &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2016/11/05/enable-new-work-item-form-in-tfs-15/">How to enable the new work Item in TFS 2017&lt;/a>, and you could have noticed some &lt;strong>differences from Visual Studio Team Service Work Item layout, or even with new Team Projects created after the upgrade&lt;/strong>.

&lt;p>If you go to your account and check the extension page, you find a situation like this one.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You could be puzzled, because there is warning icon, but no indication on what you need to do to solve the situation, nor what the problem is.

The main reason is avoiding any issue with administration or upgrades. In these years, &lt;strong>one of the main risk of having TFS on-premise is not planning for upgrade and keeping the first version installed for years&lt;/strong>. As a result, it is not uncommon to have teams that still uses TFS 2013 even if version 2017 is out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For small teams usually there is not a dedicated TFS administrator; in this situation is it strongly advisable &lt;strong>not to skip one entire major upgrade, to minimize the risk of a big bang upgrade&lt;/strong>. Suppose you have TFS 2015, I strongly suggest you to upgrade to TFS 2017, before another major version is out. This will prevent to have to upgrade 2 or more major version, with the risk of long upgrade times and too many changed that could makes the user upset.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enable new Work Item Form in TFS '15'</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/11/enable-new-work-item-form-in-tfs-15/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2016 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/11/enable-new-work-item-form-in-tfs-15/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you installed TFS 15 Preview, one &lt;strong>of the news you expected to see is the new Work Item Layout (already available in VSTS).&lt;/strong> You could get disappointed that actually your existing Work Items still are shown with the old interface, as you can see in Figure 1&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Microsoft test newer version of TFS against lots of applications to be sure that &lt;strong>newer versions of TFS do not break usage of existing tools.&lt;/strong> This means that usually you can upgrade your TFS without worrying that your VS 2010 or Visual Basic 6 stops working. You need to be aware that the opposite is not true. This imply that &lt;strong>newer version of Visual Studio could not work well with older version of TFS&lt;/strong>. This decision is done because Microsoft is encouraging people to keep their TFS installation up to date, and it would be a nightmare to always guarantee that newer tools would be able to communicate with the older service API.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scale out deployment error when migrating Reporting Services</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/07/scale-out-deployment-error-when-migrating-reporting-services/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2016 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/07/scale-out-deployment-error-when-migrating-reporting-services/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Part of moving your TFS Server on new hardware, or&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2016/07/16/create-a-pre-production-test-environment-for-your-tfs/">&lt;strong>creating a Pre-Production environment&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> &lt;strong>is restoring Reporting Server database&lt;/strong>.

&lt;p>If you move your TFS server in a new hardware be sure to follow the instructions in MSDN: &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms404869%28v=vs.120%29.aspx" title="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms404869(v=vs.120).aspx">Move or clone Team Foundation Server (hardware move)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There are many reason why you want to move TFS to a different hardware, probably you want to use a new powerful hardware and you have not virtualized TFS, or you need to upgrade TFS and you need to move Sql to a new hardware with a more recent version of SQL. Sometimes you simply want to startup with a clean TFS machine (probably you installed too much stuff in the old one, or you have some other services running in the very same machine).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Troubleshoot Error TF14044 in build vNext for TFS2015</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/01/troubleshoot-error-tf14044-in-build-vnext-for-tfs2015/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2016 17:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/01/troubleshoot-error-tf14044-in-build-vnext-for-tfs2015/</guid><description>&lt;p>I upgraded a TFS2012 to TFS2015 Update 1 at a customer site and &lt;strong>one of the reason why the customer want to upgrade is the new build system introduced in TFS 2015&lt;/strong>.

The downside of this approach, is that &lt;strong>every person is able to add whatever tag to work items with the risk of misspelling and duplication&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an example if the team is doing T-Shirt sizing for User Stories, we can have people using tag S to identify a Small Story, then people decides to change to SIZE_S to better indicate the purpose of the tag. Now you have some User Story with S and other one with SIZE_S. Mispelling is another typical problem, even if TFS is suggesting you tags in edit with drop down, there is always the risk that someone write a slightly different tag.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Limit maximum memory of SQL Server in TFS environment</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/05/limit-maximum-memory-of-sql-server-in-tfs-environment/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2015 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/05/limit-maximum-memory-of-sql-server-in-tfs-environment/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you are a small shop using on-premise TFS, probably you’ll have a single machine installation for Data and App tier for your TFS.

Basically you have two distinct way to backup your TFS: the first one is using the &lt;strong>TfsBackup.exe and TfsRestore.exe utilities&lt;/strong> as described in “&lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj620932.aspx">Backup and Restore data for TFS&lt;/a>”, the other one is the &lt;strong>scheduled backup&lt;/strong> , originally included in TFS 2010 and TFS 2012 power tools, and now part of the base product starting from TFS 2012 Update 2.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Windows 81 preview is available how can I Build with TFS</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/06/windows-8-1-preview-is-available-how-can-i-build-with-tfs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jun 2013 21:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/06/windows-8-1-preview-is-available-how-can-i-build-with-tfs/</guid><description>&lt;p>Now that Windows 8.1 preview is available, people start to think how they could compile W8.1 solutions with TFS. If you use TF Service you need only to enable a new Build Controller in preview, that is enabled to build 8.1 solutions.&lt;/p>

One of the reason could be, you started working with an account then your account changes for various reason, so you &lt;strong>need to migrate all workspaces from your old user to another user&lt;/strong>. This can be &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/54dkh0y3%28v=vs.100%29.aspx">accomplished by command line tool tf.exe&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>tf workspaces /updateUserName:OldUserName /s:sserverurl&lt;/p>
&lt;p>this should be done with your new account, and will assign all workspaces from old account to current account. If you want to change only one workspace you can go with a developer command prompt to worspace folder, digit tf worksspace to open the UI to edit workspace settings, press advanced and then change the username from there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visual Studio Tools for Git a primer</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/03/visual-studio-tools-for-git-a-primer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2013 17:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/03/visual-studio-tools-for-git-a-primer/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you installed Update 2 CTP 4 (now it has go-live and supports upgrade to RTM) you should also &lt;strong>install the&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/abafc7d6-dcaa-40f4-8a5e-d6724bdb980c">&lt;strong>Visual Studio Tools for Git&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> &lt;strong>that permits to work with Git repository directly from a Team Explorer extension&lt;/strong>.

&lt;p>TFS 2010 contains a special Group called the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc668124.aspx">&lt;strong>Work Item Only View Users&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, used to identify &lt;em>special users users that can only submit bugs and modify bugs submitted by them&lt;/em>. The reason behind this special group is to allow your customer to directly add bug into your TFS without giving them full access to the system, but the main reason to use WIOV is that &lt;strong>such users do not need a CAL to access TFS&lt;/strong>. This is really important because you can give free access to all user that needs only to submit bugs without worrying about the cost.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Installing on-premise component against TFS Service TFS On Azure</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/installing-on-premise-component-against-tfs-service-tfs-on-azure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2012 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/installing-on-premise-component-against-tfs-service-tfs-on-azure/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://tfspreview.com/">Tfs on azure&lt;/a> is a a perfectly valid solution to have your &lt;strong>TFS hosted by Microsoft&lt;/strong> , no worries about upgrading, maintaining, backup and most important, &lt;em>it is available from every computer that has an internet connection&lt;/em>.

&lt;p>First of all be sure that you have a valid workspace in your computer that maps the folder in the Team Project where you want to put your existing project and issue a &lt;strong>GetLatest&lt;/strong>.

A Workspace is a mapping between the server source control system and a local folder of a computer and until Tfs11 its state is managed by the server. One advantage of this approach is: when I ask for a “Get Latest”, the server knows the status of my workspace and can send me only the files that are changed. This has some disadvantage, all the files are readonly on disk, because you should explicitly do a “Check-Out” operation to begin editing a file, but there are also some annoying behavior: if you delete a file from the Windows explorer and you issue a Get Latest file, nothings get downloaded, because the server still believes that you have that file on your folder.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Convert Brian Keller dev11 Virtual Machine to vmWare</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/09/convert-brian-keller-dev11-virtual-machine-to-vmware/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2011 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/09/convert-brian-keller-dev11-virtual-machine-to-vmware/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/briankel/archive/2011/09/16/visual-studio-11-application-lifecycle-management-virtual-machine-and-hands-on-labs-demo-scripts.aspx">Brian Keller’s Virtual Machine&lt;/a> with all the goodness of dev11 developer preview is an Hyper-V one, so if you have a windows 7 environment (like me) you cannot use it.

&lt;p>You can install the build server on any machine you use – a workgroup machine at home, a domain machine at work, an Azure VM Role, an Amazon VM, whatever you like. TFS doesn’t really care.

&lt;p>Now that we know how to add information to a Work Item definition, it is time to deal with “state” management. Each Work Item has a field called * &lt;strong>Status&lt;/strong> *that is completely different from any other field, because has an associated workflow that manages transactions from various allowed status values. Having a workflow to manage State of a Work Item is a really powerful concept, because permits a more accurate modeling of your process. As an example suppose that in your process each bug enter the system in a status called *&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_triage#Bug_management">Triage&lt;/a>,*because is new and need to be examined by someone before a developer could actually work to its resolution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visual Studio 2010 RTM Virtual Machine Speed up</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/visual-studio-2010-rtm-virtual-machine-speed-up/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2011 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/visual-studio-2010-rtm-virtual-machine-speed-up/</guid><description>&lt;p>I usually use the &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/briankel/archive/2011/05/12/may-2011-refresh-of-visual-studio-2010-rtm-virtual-machine-with-sample-data-and-hands-on-labs.aspx">Brian Keller&amp;rsquo;s RTM Virtual Machine&lt;/a> to do TFS demo in talk or to customers.

&lt;p>In this third part it is time to configure the definition of a Work Item. This is the most complex and more useful section of the process template that you can modify to adapt to your needs. We can modify a WI definition in two distinct way: on a local process template as explained in the previous articles and directly on a Team Process that exists on the server.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Basic of TFS Process Template customization</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/basic-of-tfs-process-template-customization/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2011 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/basic-of-tfs-process-template-customization/</guid><description>&lt;p>1 – &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2011/06/22/customize-tfs-process-template/">Customize Tfs Process Template&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the first post I showed how to download the definition of a process template into a local folder and how to open it with the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb980963">Process Template Editor&lt;/a>; in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show you some of the very basic customizations that you can do with the PTE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Methodology section you can simply change the name of the Process Template as well as including a textual description. Remember that if you do not change the name, when you upload the modified version you will overwrite the original PT, so if you are planning to create a modified version of some basic template, you need to change the name first.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Customize TFS Process Template</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/customize-tfs-process-template/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2011 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/customize-tfs-process-template/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the best aspect of TFS is that it is customizable: we can interact with API, customize builds, handle events and many other interaction, but one of the most important is the ability to customize the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718795">process template.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This capability is fundamental, because permit to adapt TFS to own process, the mantra is ** &lt;strong>do not adapt your process to the tool, but adapt the tool to your process&lt;/strong> **. The purpose of an ALM tool is to support your own process, not to force the team to shape itself just to conform to the tool. The ability of a tool to adapt itself to the scenario is the key factor in choosing between various alternative. If you need a wrench you can buy the left one, that works only for a couple of bolt dimension, or you can buy the right one that is adaptable to various bolt&amp;rsquo;s dimension.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting code coverage result in drop folder during a TFS2010 buils</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/05/getting-code-coverage-result-in-drop-folder-during-a-tfs2010-buils/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2011 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/05/getting-code-coverage-result-in-drop-folder-during-a-tfs2010-buils/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2010/06/14/running-code-coverage-in-tfs2010-builds/">very old post&lt;/a> I explained how to enable code coverage in TFS2010 builds and today I received a mail asking an interesting question.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The question is: &lt;em>Is it possible to have Code Coverage result to be included in drop folder?&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Answering this question is a two phase process, the first one is understanding where MsTest store results of code coverage and verify that is possible to do something useful with them. The answer is simple, you can simply look at the TestResult directory after you execute tests inside visual studio, and you will find a data.coverage file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Installing Tfs with SP1</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/05/installing-tfs-with-sp1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2011 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/05/installing-tfs-with-sp1/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the cool feature of TFS2010 is the separation between &lt;em>installation&lt;/em>and *configuration.*If you need to install a fresh TFS2010 now that SP1 is out, you can simply install tfs, skip the configuration phase and immediately install SP1.

&lt;p>This is probably due to an authentication request, so you can try to open Team Explorer, and if it asks for credential on connecting to TFS this is the reason.

I must admit that I do not like that tool too, but this is not related to TFS, because conflicts resolution is an operation that must be done by people locally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those people, like me, that work a lot with subversion, probably &lt;a href="http://winmerge.org/">winmerge&lt;/a> is the right tool to resolve merge conflicts, and it is really simple to instruct Visual Studio to &lt;a href="http://www.neovolve.com/post/2007/06/19/using-winmerge-with-tfs.aspx">use winmerge instead of the standard tool to merge two files&lt;/a>. If you want to spend some money, &lt;a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">BeyondCompare&lt;/a> is really a great tool, suggested to me by my dear friend &lt;a href="http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/janky/Default.aspx">Janky&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Another one from the TFS Rangers</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/01/another-one-from-the-tfs-rangers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2010 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/01/another-one-from-the-tfs-rangers/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you are interested in implementing TFS 2010 in your company, or if you already implemented TFS 2010 beta2 but you want to go deeper because you want to use your tfs in a optimal way, you can check the &lt;a href="http://download.codeplex.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=VSTFS2010RM&amp;amp;amp;DownloadId=101397&amp;amp;amp;FileTime=129080088135730000&amp;amp;amp;Build=16135">Visual Studio 2010 Team Foundation SERver REquirements Management&lt;/a> guide from the TFS Rangers.

The first thing I need to do is to modify configuration files to make it work on my machine (in my situation I need only to change the sql connection string). In this scenario a big problem arise, if every developer has a different configuration file, there is the possibility that someone will do a wrong checkin, and send to the server his configuration file. This is a &lt;em>configuration hell&lt;/em> when at each check-in you grab modification to configuration file of other developers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using graphical editor with custom action in tfs2010 buils</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/12/using-graphical-editor-with-custom-action-in-tfs2010-buils/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2009 17:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/12/using-graphical-editor-with-custom-action-in-tfs2010-buils/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2009/12/07/custom-activities-in-tfs2010/">last post I&lt;/a> showed how to build a custom code activity to customize tfsbuild for beta2 of tfs2010. In that post I inserted custom action manually in the xaml file of the build definition, and I know that this can be a pain, if you want to insert a custom action in a specific part of the workflow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A simple trick is the following, copy the build definition into a test project that belong to the solution where your custom action belong, then add to the project, and you will see that your custom action magically appears into the toolbox.

If you choose tfs with ip address, you will end with an error like&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/image17.png">&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/image-thumb17.png"> &lt;img src="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/image-thumb17.png" alt="image" />&lt;/a>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This error is probably caused to the fact that windows does not support user name with ip address, in this situation the user 10.0.0.242\tfsBuildAgent really does not exists on the server.

With TFS2010 beta 2 the installation process is really more friendly. I installed a new windows server 2008 machine, update everything and begin the installation to verify the new installer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You start setup.exe, tells what you want to install, and press next, then after some minutes tfs is installed&amp;hellip; this is amazing respect to the older version. Now that everything needed was installed we need to start configuration. Suppose you want to install basic edition, it basically has source control, build machine and work item tracking, you can simply choose &lt;em>basic&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automatic deployment of a web application with TFS Build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/automatic-deployment-of-a-web-application-with-tfs-build/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Oct 2009 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/automatic-deployment-of-a-web-application-with-tfs-build/</guid><description>&lt;p>When you develop web applications you usually have X developers solving bugs and implementing features, and a series of testers that test application during developing process.

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Modifications to the trunk are visible as soon as possible to testers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data in test database gets preserved&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Point 2 is especially important, testers usually work with the site and fills database with data. Suppose that tester John find a bug that occurs only with specific data, a developer correct the bug, then a deploy is done, all test data are wiped away, and the tester is not able to verify if the bug is gone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploy a database project with TFS Build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/deploy-a-database-project-with-tfs-build/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2009 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/deploy-a-database-project-with-tfs-build/</guid><description>&lt;p>When you develop web application you often have this scenario.

One of the coolest feature is the ability to use Excel to manage workitems, without the need to even open visual studio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/image16.png">&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/image-thumb16.png"> &lt;img src="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/image-thumb16.png" alt="image" />&lt;/a>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is enough for you to install the team exploer, and you will get office integration. Excel shows a new tab in the ribbon named &lt;em>Team&lt;/em> that permits you to work with team foundation server. You can choose item specifying a standard workitem query, or you can directly create new workitem or load by id. As an example you can view all opened bugs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tfs Web access and some tinyurl magic to signal test failure</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/07/tfs-web-access-and-some-tinyurl-magic-to-signal-test-failure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2009 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/07/tfs-web-access-and-some-tinyurl-magic-to-signal-test-failure/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2009/07/03/execute-custom-code-during-tfs-build/">last post&lt;/a> of Tfs series, I showed how  to build a msbuild custom action to tweet when build test run fails. Using &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter&lt;/a> can seem strange at first, and probably not so professional to associate to a project build, but this is not true. Twitter is a free service that can be consumed from many devices, you can use tool such as &lt;a href="http://tweetdeck.com/beta/">twitterDeck&lt;/a> to manage all of your tweets in your desktop environment and to categorize them, but you can also use any mobile phone, so it is probably the most serious way to signal build problems to everyone is interested in the build process of a certain project.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
