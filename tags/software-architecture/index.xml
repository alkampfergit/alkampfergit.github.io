&lt;p>The first and obvious solution was to create a very simple component that stores cache data on application database, this is especially useful because program running from different computer could share the same cache with no problem.

I must admit that I always thought that some people gave too many importance to the UI. Quite often Project managers are the kind of people that always ask for impressive interface to show to final customers, while we, as programmers, tend to spent more attention to the &lt;em>code part&lt;/em> of the project, and usually do not care about UI.

Dto are great, but the disadvantage is that maintaining Dto objects is a pain, because they are composed by repetitive code, and you have no fun in writing them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since building a Dto is a mechanical process it is better to use a code generation tool to generate them with little effort. If you work with visual studio 2008 the best choice in Code Generator is T4, because it is included in Visual Studio and is really good.

&lt;li>Analyst is a moron, he did a bad job not finding the real requirement of the customer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Customer are stupid because they does not know what they want, they are constantly changing requirements.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We lack requirement gathering phase, now we must loose time following desires of Analyst/Customer&lt;/li>

&lt;p>With such a code Bart&amp;rsquo;s parent is Mark, but Bart is in John Child collection, this is WRONG. To avoid this problem you should maintain integrity in the domain model, managing the consistency of the relationship. Suppose you have the same situation with two objects, a StockKeepingUnit and a StockContainer, here it is the code for StockKeepingUnit&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adapting a model to make binding simpler</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/03/adapting-a-model-to-make-binding-simpler/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2009 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/03/adapting-a-model-to-make-binding-simpler/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have a domain model composed by Clients, each client has a series of associated Typology objects and each Typology object has a certain number of associated Target.

&lt;p>The model is not directly accessible, I have already a service that has functions like GetAllCustomer, GetTyplogyForCustomer(Int32 customerId) and GetTargetForTyplogy(Int32 typologyId). Each method returns a list of the corresponding object, but they are DTO and not real object, so the Customer, Typology and Target returned from the service have no relation between them. Moreover I do not want to load everything when the application starts, because it will be extremely slow, I want to be able to load data as it needed, with lazy load.

I think that this is a very important subject, especially for medium sized or big project. If you fail to organize your source code including everything you will end with trouble. In the past it happened to me to work on project where you need to spend a lot of time just to have the first run ok. I need to download and install tools, libraries, then I need to open a solution, compile and move dll into another folder etc etc etc. This situation is a clear indication of a bad organization of the trunk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Extend BindingList with filter functionality</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/11/extend-bindinglist-with-filter-functionality/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2008 05:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/11/extend-bindinglist-with-filter-functionality/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you still work with windows forms and cannot move all of your projects to WPF, you probably gets annoyed by the limitation of the standard BindingList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; included in the framework. In an &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2007/10/12/bindinglistfind-and-notimplementedexception/">old post&lt;/a> I showed how can you create a specialized BindingList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; to support generic Find() thanks to reflection, but this is not enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another annoying limitation is that BindingList does not support IBindingListView. For those that does not knows this interface, it is the one used by the windows forms binding engine to support filtering and advanced sorting. I think that filtering is a real basic functionality needed by the binding engine, and in fact WPF support for filtering, sorting and grouping, make these operations really a breeze. But BindingList does not offers such a functionality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Impedence between domain objects and Ui Layer</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/11/impedence-between-domain-objects-and-ui-layer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2008 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/11/impedence-between-domain-objects-and-ui-layer/</guid><description>&lt;p>When you work with domain model your domain objects become more complex than a simple containers for table values. This makes somewhat problematic using these object directly with the UI, especially when you use native binding. Let&amp;rsquo;s make an example, I have this object called &lt;strong>Domain&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/image10.png">&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/image-thumb10.png"> &lt;img src="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/image-thumb10.png" alt="image" />&lt;/a>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see the Domain class has a property called ContentBlackList that is a List of String. The setter is private and in the getter the list is created lazily, then I have a &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2008/10/21/some-details-on-older-post-about-usertype/">User Type&lt;/a> to map this property into a single field of a table in a list of string separated by the charachter #.

&lt;p>Lets analyze this typical situation from the perspective of the stakeholder; he have all the reason to ask for new features, he does not possess strong technical skills, and since he is the one who actually &lt;em>pay to build the software&lt;/em>, he does not understand why he cannot ask for a simple modification.
