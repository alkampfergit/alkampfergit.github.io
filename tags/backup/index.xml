During the past I&amp;rsquo;ve heard people saying, *Hey I&amp;rsquo;ve this RAID 1 array, so I do not need backup, because if a disk will fail I have data in the other one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is WRONG!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are still convinced that RAID 1 or 5 can replace a backup consider these situations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Good paper come back to use</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/good-paper-come-back-to-use/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Aug 2009 03:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/good-paper-come-back-to-use/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve just read another &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001292.html">good post of Jeff Atwood&lt;/a>, that speak about &lt;a href="http://ollydbg.de/Paperbak/">PaperBack&lt;/a>. I must admit that in 2009 it seems an oddity to claim for backup on paper, but it is an interesting and viable option to backup data. I must admit that I really love books, I like to have a book in my hand and I really love paper. Doing a backup on paper is really cool, because you can really touch your backup, with hands, and you can visually states that it is in good condition using only your eyes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
