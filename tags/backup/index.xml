During the past I&amp;rsquo;ve heard people saying, *Hey I&amp;rsquo;ve this RAID 1 array, so I do not need backup, because if a disk will fail I have data in the other one.
This is WRONG!!!
If you are still convinced that RAID 1 or 5 can replace a backup consider these situations.</description></item><item><title>Good paper come back to use</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/good-paper-come-back-to-use/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Aug 2009 03:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/good-paper-come-back-to-use/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just read another good post of Jeff Atwood, that speak about PaperBack. I must admit that in 2009 it seems an oddity to claim for backup on paper, but it is an interesting and viable option to backup data. I must admit that I really love books, I like to have a book in my hand and I really love paper. Doing a backup on paper is really cool, because you can really touch your backup, with hands, and you can visually states that it is in good condition using only your eyes.</description></item></channel></rss>
