One of the key optimizations in these pipelines is the use of shallow fetch when cloning repositories. Unlike a full clone, which downloads the entire history of the repository, a shallow fetch retrieves only the specific commit needed for the build. This is a really welcomed feature, because repositories can contain years of history, or they can have some big file committed by error in some older commit.</description></item></channel></rss>
