In previous example I demonstrated how you can decompose a complex operation in multiple steps, actually guiding Copilot towards desired result.
Now the question is: Once you got it right, is it possible to use a single prompt to have desired result?</description></item><item><title>GitHub Copilot-X in action: generation of test object with reandom data</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/copilot-x-few-shot-prompt/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/copilot-x-few-shot-prompt/</guid><description>In real world software you often have complex classes, in this situation we have AtomicReadmodels in a project heavily based on Event Sourcing. One challenge they present is the presence of only private setters for all properties - a necessity due to the unconventional nature of these classes, which rely on parsing domain events for property population. This results in difficulties when creating test classes in memory during unit testing, as the private setters block external code from setting properties.</description></item></channel></rss>
