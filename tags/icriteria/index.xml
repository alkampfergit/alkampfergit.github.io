I do not want to give a deep explanation of this problem, you can find information &lt;a href="http://legeronline.blogspot.com/2009/03/evils-of-slow-paramaterized-query-plans.html">here&lt;/a>, but I want to outline the general problem to make clear what is happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can argue a lot why this problem happens in a database engine, but basically I have a really bad situation where the db stores data of multiple customers with really non uniform distribution of data (some of them have ~1000 rows for each table, others have ~100.000 rows in some of the tables).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NHibernate ICriteria and filters</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/nhibernate-icriteria-and-filters/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2009 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/nhibernate-icriteria-and-filters/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have a project where I need to access tables with millions of rows, the project was born without nhibernate so the database was not designed with ORM in mind. I decided to improve performances with an Indexed view that materialized a join between five tables, wrapped with another view that does a left outer joins with other 3 tables. Then I created an entity called XXXDto, and mapped with nhibernate, with update=&lt;em>false&lt;/em> to prevent updating and pointed it to this view.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
