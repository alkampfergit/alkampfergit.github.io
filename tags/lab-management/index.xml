The reasons behind the need to completely remove Lab Management configuration could be various, one of the most common is: you created a cloned copy of your TFS environment for testing purpose, and you want to be 100% sure that your cloned instance does not contact SCVMM, or you can simply have multiple Test TFS Instance and you need to move lab management from one instance to another.</description></item><item><title>Error in AsyncProcessMessage during deploy phase of a TFS Lab Management Build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/02/error-in-asyncprocessmessage-during-deploy-phase-of-a-tfs-lab-management-build/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2014 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/02/error-in-asyncprocessmessage-during-deploy-phase-of-a-tfs-lab-management-build/</guid><description>I have a customer that experiences this error during a build with Lab Management:

Since Lab Management is really a complex set of tools, even if it is in the iso images of TFS 2010 is still considered to be in release candidate version. Now we can announce two big news
RTM Bits will be released at the end of August Lab managements will be avaliable even in MSDN Ultimate or TestProfessional with MSDN The second news is very well welcomed, because it widen the number of people that could benefit from Lab Management.</description></item><item><title>Deploy a solution and a database in a Lab Management Virtual Environment</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/06/deploy-a-solution-and-a-database-in-a-lab-management-virtual-environment/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2010 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/06/deploy-a-solution-and-a-database-in-a-lab-management-virtual-environment/</guid><description>One of the coolest feature of Tfs2010 is Lab Management, an infrastructure tool that permits you to manage Virtual Environment to test your applications. Once you have defined some template machine in SCVMM you can import them into your Lab to be used in defining Virtual Environment.
When you imported all the templates you need from SCVMM, to create a new environment you simply need to go to Environment tab, and create new virtual environment, then you can choose VM template to compose a test environment, like in the following picture where I choose three machine, a web server, a db server and a client machine.</description></item><item><title>Lab management TF267042 and dns configuration</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/06/lab-management-tf267042-and-dns-configuration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2010 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/06/lab-management-tf267042-and-dns-configuration/</guid><description>Today I configured an environment in lab management, when it finishes the deploy phase I see that the machine has testing capabilities Error and the details of the error is

The following host is unusable for Lab Management: xxxx in host group: &amp;ldquo;All Hosts&amp;rdquo;. To make it usable, connect at least one of its physical network adapters to a valid network. Then, verify the host group again to ensure that the problem has been resolved.</description></item><item><title>Preparing template machine for Lab Management</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/04/preparing-template-machine-for-lab-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2010 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/04/preparing-template-machine-for-lab-management/</guid><description>Quite often, customers ask for web application to be fully compatible with IE6 IE7 and IE8, so you need to always have some virtual machine with all version of IE running somewhere. In such a scenario, having right template machine in Lab Management can be a good option, so I decided to try it out and create some template machine to use in this scenario.
First of all I created a simple virtual machine in hyper-v, install WindowsXP SP3, and did all the update, except Internet explorer, so my system is fully updated with latest patch but with IE6.</description></item><item><title>Scvmm could not reset local administrator password during template creation</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/03/scvmm-could-not-reset-local-administrator-password-during-template-creation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Mar 2010 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/03/scvmm-could-not-reset-local-administrator-password-during-template-creation/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m creating some template in SCVMM to be used with lab management, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a windows XP client machine, joined to the domain, installed and configured Test Agent and finally I used SCVMM to convert the machine to a template.
The process finish with an error
Could not reset local Administrator password on WinXPIE8 to empty string before starting Sysprep.(The password does not meet the password policy requirements. Check the minimum password length, etc etc The problem is that, since the machine was joined to the domain, even if I open gpedit.</description></item><item><title>Lab Management VDH Up and running</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/02/lab-management-vdh-up-and-running/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2010 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/02/lab-management-vdh-up-and-running/</guid><description>With VS2010 RC MS had released a vhd to evaluate Lab Management. This is a very good news, and since I already have a Beta2 Lab Management Up and running I want to try the VHD to see what is improved on RC.
Lab Management is and environment, so there is not a way you can simply launch the vhd and play with it, you absolutely need to setup an environment and follow this detailed tutorial.</description></item><item><title>Workflow and test capability not enabled in lab management</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/12/workflow-and-test-capability-not-enabled-in-lab-management/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2009 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/12/workflow-and-test-capability-not-enabled-in-lab-management/</guid><description>I deployed my first machine with lab management, but when the deploy finished I verify that workflow capability and test capability are not enabled in the machine. This is how you should see deployed machine
If the hilighted icons have a red cross instead of the play button you have a problem. Quite always the problem rely on permissions, so the best way to solve it is to connect to the machine and take a look at event viewer.</description></item><item><title>Configuring Lab Management problem with network location</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/12/configuring-lab-management-problem-with-network-location/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2009 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/12/configuring-lab-management-problem-with-network-location/</guid><description>You can check the original post here, but I want to explain again how you can solve problem with network location during setup of Lab Management (because it happened to me both time I configured labmanagement, in desktop machine and in laptop machine), the problem manifests itself with this symptom
You configure your machine with SCVMM, you test it and everything went ok, but the combo with network location is empty.</description></item><item><title>On a way to lab management 8211 TF260078 error</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/12/on-a-way-to-lab-management-tf260078-error/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2009 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/12/on-a-way-to-lab-management-tf260078-error/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m configuring Lab Management in the virtual machine with the test contrller and TFS, but when it ask me for credentials to connect to System Center Virtual Machine Manager, I specify the credentials of Domain Admin and it gives me this error.
It is strange, because administrator is the user I currently use to manage SCVMM, but maybe there is some restrictions to be used by the Lab management agent, so I decided to create a specific user in active directory called Labmanagement, and then goes to the administration tab of SCVMM and added to the admin role</description></item><item><title>On a way to lab management</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/12/on-a-way-to-lab-management/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Dec 2009 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/12/on-a-way-to-lab-management/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m installing Lab Management, and since it is a complex environment some problems can arise. I&amp;rsquo;m following the four part tutorial that you can find here, and this morning I face the first problem.
When I try to add my Hyper-V host to the Vitual Machine Manager (SCVMM) I have this problem.
As you can see, when I try to add an Hyper-V enabled machine (The same where SCVMM is running) it tells me that virtualization software is Unknown, even if hyper-V is up and running fine.</description></item><item><title>VS2010 lab management blog</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/11/vs2010-lab-management-blog/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2009 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/11/vs2010-lab-management-blog/</guid><description>I really believe that Lab Management is the most exiting stuff introduced with VS2010, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy that it has a dedicated blog, take a look at it :)
