There is some service that has a method called GetCustomers() and this function is used from a web application and a Windows application. Since landing web page use this function to show all customers data, and since Customers entity changes rarely we decide to put the result of this service call in Cache with 1 hour absolute expiration.
Web interface is made in WebForms, so we used an ObjectDataSource to communicate with the service, here is the code.</description></item><item><title>Read and learn to use a tool instead of Try and learn</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/12/read-and-learn-to-use-a-tool-instead-of-try-and-learn/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2010 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/12/read-and-learn-to-use-a-tool-instead-of-try-and-learn/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a very noob Blend user and I learn it without reading or seeing any tutorial, just opened blend and begin to use it&amp;hellip; this is no good because I missed some basic features like for example that the grid can be put in Canvas or Grid mode&amp;hellip;

The main reason is that Brian had really wrote tons of good code and it is really interesting knowing how he organize his projects. From this first post I strongly agree with a couple of concepts, the first is having a clean code at regular interval, no longer than few hours.
I made mistake in the past, and sometimes in the present, I begin coding a super new feature, with a lot of code, and after some hours I have nothing working because I&amp;rsquo;m still doing infrastructure code, etc etc.</description></item><item><title>Have you backup your data today</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/12/have-you-backup-your-data-today/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2009 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/12/have-you-backup-your-data-today/</guid><description>I was reading this post, and I really agree with Jeff, every day is international Backup Awareness Day.

Going in production can be sometimes a really difficult thing to do, and there are a lot of reasons behind it.
First of all we have the syndrome of * It works on my machine *.

The argument of the discussion is what university misses to taught, this question arise because a lot of persons that comes out of university are not immediately productive in a company. Except people that had previously experiences while studying, quite often freshly graduated programmer needs some time to be really productive at work.
These days I was thinking about this specific discussion, and I realized that probably the reason is related to this post.</description></item><item><title>Good programmers put code in production</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/05/good-programmers-put-code-in-production/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2009 03:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/05/good-programmers-put-code-in-production/</guid><description>Some days ago I did a post that generates a lot of comments, it is called Java Versus.Net Programmers, and it made me think that there are a lot of ideas out of there on what are the characteristics that makes a good programmer

You can use this technique to build the ExpressionTreeReflection class.
You can now write code like this

Lets analyze this typical situation from the perspective of the stakeholder; he have all the reason to ask for new features, he does not possess strong technical skills, and since he is the one who actually pay to build the software, he does not understand why he cannot ask for a simple modification.</description></item><item><title>Is policies for password really useful</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/08/is-policies-for-password-really-useful/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2008 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/08/is-policies-for-password-really-useful/</guid><description>This argument is discussed in the excellent book “Why Software Sucks“, password policies are really useful?
I give you my opinion. I have really a lot of username/password ranges from my home banking account to various sites like, flickr, dotnetkick etc etc. My problem is that the amount of passwords is becoming really huge and I need a way to remember them with easy.
The obvious solution is using the same password for every site, but this is really insecure, if some site does not protects well my password (store it in clear text), a malicious user can grab username and password and can try to use it for other sites.</description></item><item><title>Crunch mode is effective</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/08/crunch-mode-is-effective/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2008 04:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/08/crunch-mode-is-effective/</guid><description>I stumbled on this post of Marco, that directed me on the original post, speaking about crunch time. In my experience it is a very abused technique, expecially here in Italy, where managers tells you “We are late, we are not in time, we must hurry, we must work more!”
The original articles shows a lot of reasons why crunch time is not the solution to speed up the process, but in the end there are more, not really related to productivity, or sleep time or some other physical condition.</description></item><item><title>Share documents in a distributed team</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/06/share-documents-in-a-distributed-team/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2008 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/06/share-documents-in-a-distributed-team/</guid><description>Some days ago I received a mail with an analysis document for a Project I’m working to. Since we are a distributed team of programmers, someone still uses mail to share document with members of the team.
This is simply WRONG!!! * The reason are
It lacks tracking. Some people uses to append a version such as Document_Ver32.doc, but this is prone to error. If A and B modify the same document at the same time then we will have two version of Document_Ver33.</description></item><item><title>The importance of good communication</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/06/the-importance-of-good-communication/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2008 05:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/06/the-importance-of-good-communication/</guid><description>In a team, communication between members is of great importance. I found that a lot of bug or mistakes in software development, quite often derive from incomplete or not well conducted analysis.
I’m not an expert of software analysis, but I found that a quite good analysis, even an informal one, can give great benefit to whole software development process. It is not important to conduct perfect analysis, or that it covers all details, but there are some aspects that are really more important than anothers.</description></item><item><title>History of a merge</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/06/history-of-a-merge/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2008 00:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/06/history-of-a-merge/</guid><description>Source control management is the key to work on a team, but to work with it efficiently there is the need of experience.
