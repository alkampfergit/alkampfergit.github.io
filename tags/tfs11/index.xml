The Workspace model of TFS was somewhat criticized in the past, because it is logically Server Side, because TFS Server, in each moment, knows the situation of each workspace.
This choice has, (as any choice in real life :) ) good and bad point.</description></item><item><title>Running NUnit and xUnit tests in TFS11 build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/running-nunit-and-xunit-tests-in-tfs11-build/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2012 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/running-nunit-and-xunit-tests-in-tfs11-build/</guid><description>Iâ€™ve blogged in the past various solution to run NUnit tests during a TFS build, and now it is time to make it again for TFS11, but this time it is incredibly simple, because the new Test Runner supports multiple frameworks, so it works almost automatically.
You can read from Peter Provost blog that actually we have three plugin for UTE (Unit Test Explorer) available: Nunit, xUnit and HTML/JAvascript, they are simple.</description></item><item><title>TFS 11 and Kanban</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/tfs-11-and-kanban/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Mar 2012 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/tfs-11-and-kanban/</guid><description>Visual studio ALM Rangers just published a good pratical guide for using kanban on TFS 11, I suggest you to have a look at the guide, because is really interesting.
