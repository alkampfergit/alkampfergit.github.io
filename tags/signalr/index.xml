To verify this you can write a simple test with a simple hub that each second broadcasts to all clients current server timestamp with a simple timer.

This is the Repro Steps for the bug:
1) the user open a browser tab to a public page that uses SignalR
2) he opens another tab in the browser and navigate to a private page that requires authentication
3) he logins into the system and Signalr in the first tab stops working.
The page stops to receive server calls and if I call some Hub function from javascript I got no javascript error in Developer Console, but done function is never called.</description></item></channel></rss>
