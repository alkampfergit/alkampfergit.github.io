Azure DevOps allows you to create Dashboards to visualize interesting metrics, but actually you do not have a way to create Dynamic Dashboards, I.E. a Dashboard that allows you to specify a parametric query so you can, for example, change the iteration and view how the data changes.</description></item><item><title>Retrieve Attachment in Azure DevOps with REST API</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2019/07/retrieve-attachment-in-azure-devops-with-rest-api/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2019 20:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2019/07/retrieve-attachment-in-azure-devops-with-rest-api/</guid><description>In a previous post I’ve dealt on how to retrieve image in Work Items description or Comments with a simple WebClient request, using network credentials taken from TfsTeamProjectCollection class.
The solution presented in that article is not complete, because it does not works against Azure Devops, but only against a on-premise TFS or Azure DevOps Server . If you connect to Azure DevOps you will find that the Credentials of the TfsTeamProjectCollection class are null , thus you cannot download the attachment because the web request is not authenticated.</description></item><item><title>Export Work Item Information to Word Document</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2019/07/export-work-item-information-to-word-document/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2019 19:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2019/07/export-work-item-information-to-word-document/</guid><description>This is a series of posts on how to export data from Azure DevOps to a Word Document, composing word templates with Open XML Sdk.

I’ve dealt in the past on this subject, showing how you can retrieve images with Store and Attachment Work Item Property.
Sadly enough, I’ve encountered situation with on-premise version of TFS where I found this type of image src inside HTML fields.</description></item><item><title>Create Word document from Work Items</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/12/create-word-document-from-work-items/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/12/create-word-document-from-work-items/</guid><description>Post in the series:
API Connection Retrieve Work Items Information Azure DevOps API, Embed images into HTML Now we have all the prerequisites in place to connect to an Azure DevOps account, execute a query to grab all work items of a sprint and modifying HTML of Rich Edit fields to embed images. It is time to create a word document.
To have a better look and feel of exported document, the best approach is using the concept of Templates created by simple Word documents.</description></item><item><title>Azure DevOps API Embed images into html</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/12/azure-devops-api-embed-images-into-html/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/12/azure-devops-api-embed-images-into-html/</guid><description>Post in the series:
API Connection Retrieve Work Items Information Before going to generate a Word File from Work Item Data we need to solve a little problem with HTML content in Work Item fields. As you know Azure DevOps has a rich web editor that allows you to create complex text in some fields, like Description, the problem is: whenever you copy and paste images inside the Web Editor, those images were added as Work Item attachments and the real HTML content is just a reference to the attachmen Url.</description></item><item><title>Azure DevOps API Retrieve Work Items Information</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/12/azure-devops-api-retrieve-work-items-information/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/12/azure-devops-api-retrieve-work-items-information/</guid><description>Post in the series:
API Connection Now that we know how to connect to Azure DevOps services, it is time to understand how to retrieve information about Work Items to accomplish the requested task: export Work Items data inside a Word Document.
Once you connected to Azure DevOps account you start retrieving helper classes to work with the different functions of the service, if you need to interact with Work Items you need a reference to the WorkItemStore class.</description></item><item><title>Azure Devops API Connection</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/12/azure-devops-api-connection/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Dec 2018 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/12/azure-devops-api-connection/</guid><description>One of the great benefit of using Azure DevOps is the ability to interact with the service through API calls, making it possible to extend the service with a few bunch of C#, or PowerShell or whatever language you want, because almost everything is exposed with REST API, and a simple HTTP call is enough.
Since I’m mostly a C# and.NET guy, I’ll explain how to build a C# program that interact with an Azure DevOps account, because thanks to Nuget Packages offered by Microsoft, you can interact with your account with Strongly Typed C# classes, so you can have intellisense and compile type checking to verify that everything is good.</description></item><item><title>Nuget packages for TFS VSO Client Object Model</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/08/nuget-packages-for-tfs-vso-client-object-model/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2015 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/08/nuget-packages-for-tfs-vso-client-object-model/</guid><description>Finally the Client Object Model for TFS / VSO is finally distributed with Nuget Packages, as you can read here. This is a great news especially because the Dll are finally redistributable, and your tool does not need to require a previous installation of Visual Studio or Team Explorer, or Client Object Model Package.
Another interesting fact, is that REST API are now supported for TFS 2015 / VSO (previous version of TFS does not support REST API).</description></item><item><title>Use a WebBrowser to login into a site that use HttpOnly cookie</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/04/use-a-webbrowser-to-login-into-a-site-that-use-httponly-cookie/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2011 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/04/use-a-webbrowser-to-login-into-a-site-that-use-httponly-cookie/</guid><description>Suppose you need to programmatically analyze some web pages that are protected by a login procedure and you have a valid login to the site.
