&lt;p>Several years ago I had a friend called me for a problem with MongoDb, it turns out that &lt;strong>someone, from an IP geolocated in China, accessed the instances during the night and wiped out everything&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem was due to some misconfiguration or human error or whatever that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>turned off Windows firewall and port 27017 was open to the internet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MongoDb was installed with no password.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MongoDb was bound to all ip addresses of the machine&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>When it is time to protect your data, you &lt;strong>should add as many layers / techniques of protection as you can&lt;/strong>, this because, if one if them is failing, another one can still offer protection.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
