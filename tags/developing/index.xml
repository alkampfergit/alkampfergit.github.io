The problem was due to some misconfiguration or human error or whatever that:
turned off Windows firewall and port 27017 was open to the internet MongoDb was installed with no password. MongoDb was bound to all ip addresses of the machine When it is time to protect your data, you should add as many layers / techniques of protection as you can, this because, if one if them is failing, another one can still offer protection.</description></item></channel></rss>
