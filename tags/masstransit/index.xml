If you do not want to have a central dispatcher, because you need to install a windows service (or run program in console) and a sql server used by the dispatcher you can also avoid this using Multicast.
The key is the call to sbc.</description></item><item><title>Masstransit and dispatching of messages</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/09/masstransit-and-dispatching-of-messages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Sep 2012 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/09/masstransit-and-dispatching-of-messages/</guid><description>One of the coolest aspect of Masstransit is simplicity of use (even if it still lacks a really comprehensive documentation ), dispatching of message is one of this aspect. The key of Masstransit is that dispatching is done on type of the message instead that address, we can simply ignore everything in the middle, we have just components that declares to Masstransit that they are able to handle a certain type of messages, other components will simply publish messages in the bus and dispatching is done thanks to the CLR type of message sent.</description></item><item><title>Quick start on Mass Transit and MSMQ on windows</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/08/quick-start-on-mass-transit-and-msmq-on-windows/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Aug 2012 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/08/quick-start-on-mass-transit-and-msmq-on-windows/</guid><description>MassTransit is a bus implementation for.NET that promise frictionless configuration and simple usage. The main problem about MassTransit in my opinion is the lack of organic documentation, especially a quick start guide that shows you really the basic concepts behind MassTransit. If you jump into online documentation there is a nice page called “Show Me the code” that promise a quick start to jump into MassTransit concepts. The problem with that example is that it shows a single snippet of code that opens a bus based on Windows MSMQ and send a message to itself.</description></item></channel></rss>
