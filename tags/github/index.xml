And this because, actually, using merge will make your repository history a mess.
For a lot of years, this kind of suggestion was not so common. I&amp;rsquo;ve always looked at the teams happily used merge and then complain about how difficult is to read the story of the repository.</description></item><item><title>Resolving Credential Conflicts in Git</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/pills/multiple-credentials-in-credential-manager/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 08:10:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/pills/multiple-credentials-in-credential-manager/</guid><description>Have you ever found yourself being asked to select a GitHub account every time you make a push? This is often due to multiple access tokens being stored in your Windows credential manager.
The Git Credential Manager can become confused when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t know which account to use. It&amp;rsquo;s only option in these situations is to ask you which of the stored credentials it should utilize.

For example, suppose I need to share a link to a pull request that is under review with one of my colleagues for them to comment on. Sure, I could navigate to the GitHub website, locate the repository, navigate to the pull request page and get the link.</description></item><item><title>GitHub Copilot-X in action: Steps instructions in a single prompt</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/copilot-few-shot-part-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/copilot-few-shot-part-2/</guid><description>If you look at previous post on the subject I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting with Copilot Chat to have it automate mundane, repetitive operation but that can operate on complex classes. In previous example I demonstrated how you can decompose a complex operation in multiple steps, actually guiding Copilot towards desired result.
Now the question is: Once you got it right, is it possible to use a single prompt to have desired result?</description></item><item><title>GitHub Copilot-X in action: generation of test object with random data</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/copilot-x-few-shot-prompt/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/copilot-x-few-shot-prompt/</guid><description>In real world software you often have complex classes, in this situation we have AtomicReadmodels in a project heavily based on Event Sourcing. One challenge they present is the presence of only private setters for all properties - a necessity due to the unconventional nature of these classes, which rely on parsing domain events for property population. This results in difficulties when creating test classes in memory during unit testing, as the private setters block external code from setting properties.</description></item><item><title>Unleashing the Power of Copilot in Visual Studio for Exception Handling</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/unleashing-the-power-of-copilot-in-visual-studio-for-exception-handling.md/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/unleashing-the-power-of-copilot-in-visual-studio-for-exception-handling.md/</guid><description>While running a program, when an exception occurs, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s easy to figure out what caused it. Other times, it can be more complex, especially in the case of unique exceptions you might not be familiar with. Here, having Copilot chat inside Visual Studio offers an extra gear. Within the exception menu, we now have an option that allows us to ask Copilot for information on that specific exception.</description></item><item><title>GitHub Copilot-X in action: simple code conversion</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/copilot-x-chat-rewrite/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/copilot-x-chat-rewrite/</guid><description>New Copilot X from GitHub is the next big thing for programmers, because it brings the power of copilot to the next level. Actually I&amp;rsquo;m testing the integrated chat in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. The tool is not always perfect, but we really need to understand how and where to use it to gain maximum advantage.
We often encounter conversion operations that are very mechanical, boring, and prone to errors due to their repetitiveness.</description></item><item><title>Troubleshooting GitHub Codespaces PGP Signing Problems</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/codespaces-troubleshooting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/codespaces-troubleshooting/</guid><description>If you use GPG keys to verify your commits, you&amp;rsquo;ll be glad to know that in GitHub Codespaces, signing is done automatically. All you need to do is configure the settings in your account, and a key will be injected into your Codespaces. As a result, every commit you make in your Codespace will be automatically signed and verified.

Actually the answer is somewhat complex, but the most honest response is to use whatever of the two you find more adherent on how you work.
The most different part is the issue/board part, because they are very different on the two products, with very different capabilities and very different basic concepts.</description></item><item><title>GitHub actions templates</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/github-actions-templates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/github-actions-templates/</guid><description>GitHub Actions are closing the gap with Azure DevOps pipelines day by day, one of the features introduces months ago was Action templates, the ability to re-use actions definitions between repositories. You can read all the detail in Official GitHub documentation.
Templates are really useful because usually, in one organization, you tend to use a restricted set of technologies with the very same set of actions to perform to build and release the code.</description></item><item><title>GitHub Actions permission settings</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/action-permission/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/action-permission/</guid><description>Continuous integration is absolutely vital for a healthy software project, but in many situation people gave little attention to security. If you are running CI workflows in your machine where you control the code that is build and every script that is run by CI engine, you are pretty fine. In that scenario an attacker should take control of your code to run some malicious script during a CI run, but if you are using a third party task/extension/action, the situation is different.</description></item><item><title>Analyze Python project with SonarCloud and GitHub</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/python-sonarcloud-actions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/python-sonarcloud-actions/</guid><description>SonarCloud is free for Open Source projects, and for languages like Python, that does not need compilation, it can directly analyze the repository without any intervention from the author. This feature is automatically enabled when you setup your Project in SonarCloud and it determines that you have not compiled language.

If you look at Figure you can see that in my situation I have a Continuous Integration based analysis and my automatic analysis is disabled.</description></item><item><title>Configure Codespaces for Python projects</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/codespaces-python/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/codespaces-python/</guid><description>One of the great advantage of Codespaces is the ability to preconfigure the environment so you do not need to waste time installing and configuring your toolchain. Python is a perfect example of this scenario, I&amp;rsquo;ve a small project to generate Git Graph Representation and since I&amp;rsquo;m not a full time Python developer, I&amp;rsquo;ve not it installed and perfectly configured in all of my environment. Also I primarily work on Windows, so Codespaces allows me to test everything on Linux with a single click.</description></item><item><title>Configure Codespaces for a real project</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/configuring-codespaces/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/configuring-codespaces/</guid><description>In previous post I explored the many advantages I&amp;rsquo;ve found using GitHub codespaces to author blog posts directly in a browser. That example was surely too simple, after all a hugo blog is just markdown, but nevertheless Codespaces allows me to configure my environment with great easy.
You can follow the guide on the official link but here is a quick summary on how I configured my codespaces for my blog.</description></item><item><title>Use GitHub codespaces to author blog post</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/codespaces-hugo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/codespaces-hugo/</guid><description>The scenario I played a little bit with GitHub Codespaces when it was in preview, now it is time to try to use it real activities to understand scenarios where it can be useful.
To have a real test you need to setup a goal to verify if the tool is capable of reaching that goal, and if it is an advantage over existing tool. My first goal is being able to write Blog Post in hugo with GitHub Codespaces and being able to determine if it is more productive than running a standalone local version of Visual Studio code.</description></item><item><title>Choose environment from branch in GitHub action</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/choose-environment-from-branch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/choose-environment-from-branch/</guid><description>I have a friend that asked me how to choose an enviroment in a GitHub action based on the branch that triggered the action. Usually Environments are used in a sort of Promotion mechanism, where you start deploying on Test, then you have a manual or automatic approval to deploy on staging and finally to production. Even if this is a textbook scenario sometimes you need to create a simple sequence of steps to deploy your software in an environment and you want to choose environment based on branch.</description></item><item><title>Code coverage in SonarCloud and GitHub Actions</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/github-sonarcloud-codecoverage/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 19:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/github-sonarcloud-codecoverage/</guid><description>First of all I want to thank my friend Giulio Vian for pointing me in the right direction and for its great work in TfsAggregator Action.
