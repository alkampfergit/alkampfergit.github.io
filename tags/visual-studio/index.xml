You starts with the very first assembly in the chain of dependency, the one that does not depends on any other assembly in the project, and you start checking compatibility with.NET standard for all referenced NuGet Packages. Once the first project is done you proceed with the remaining.</description></item><item><title>Converting a big project to new VS2017 csproj format</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/10/converting-a-big-project-to-new-vs2017-csproj-format/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2018 14:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/10/converting-a-big-project-to-new-vs2017-csproj-format/</guid><description>Visual Studio 2017 introduced a new.csproj file format for C# project that is the key to move to.NET Standard but it is useful also for project with Full Framework, because is more human manageable.
The main drawback of this approach is that you end compatibility with older version of VS , if you open the.csproj with VS2015 you are not able to compile the project anymore. For this reason, switching to new format should be a decision that is well discussed in the team.</description></item><item><title>Configure Visual Studio 2017 155 for pull 8211rebase</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/12/configure-visual-studio-2017-15-5-for-pull-rebase/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2017 12:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/12/configure-visual-studio-2017-15-5-for-pull-rebase/</guid><description>I’m a great fan of rebasing over merge and I’m convinced that the default pull should be a fetch and rebase , using fetch and merge only when it is really needed.

Basically with a symbol server you can reference a dll in your project, but you can debug original source code as if you have the original project linked instead of having the dll.
Sometimes this process just don’t work. Recently I’have a customer that had problem with this scenario, and the real strange stuff is: I’m able to step in dll source code without problem from any machine, but noone of the customer’s developers are able to make it work.</description></item><item><title>Quickly run Unit Test With VS 20122013</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/04/quickly-run-unit-test-with-vs-20122013/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2015 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/04/quickly-run-unit-test-with-vs-20122013/</guid><description>With VS 2012 and newer versions we can run Unit Tests from various frameworks directly from Visual Studio IDE , thanks to the concept of Test Adapters. When you are doing Test Driven Development you usually go with Red/Green/Refactor workflow; what you need is a way to quickly run all or part of your unit tests after you modified the code. The quickest solution is using the option to Run Tests After Build but it is available only for Premium and Ultimate edition, but you can also run test with little manual intervention resorting to Keyboard Shortcut.</description></item><item><title>Nunit test not found for some assemblies with Visual Studio Test Runner</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/04/nunit-test-not-found-for-some-assemblies-with-visual-studio-test-runner/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 12:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/04/nunit-test-not-found-for-some-assemblies-with-visual-studio-test-runner/</guid><description>I’ve a project in Visual Studio 2013 where one of the assembly containing Tests refuses to show tests in Test Explorer window.

You can create your first Coded UI test following simple instruction from MSDN documentation. Most of the introductory examples shows you how you can use the Recorder tools to record interaction with a software (Web, WinForm, Wpf. etc) to generate what is called a UiMap. An UiMap is nothing more than a big Xml files where the recorder records the interaction with the UI and a bunch of automatic generated classes to interact with the UI.</description></item><item><title>Removing Network Emulation of Visual Studio Test Runner</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/11/removing-network-emulation-of-visual-studio-test-runner/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2013 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/11/removing-network-emulation-of-visual-studio-test-runner/</guid><description>Visual Studio has the ability to simulate network speeds during test executio n.

There are several reason to do this, first of all probably many of the subsequent error can be caused by the fact that a base project does not compile, or simply the build process takes a long time that it is not useful to continue the build when a project does not build , (quite often we are interested only in build the whole solution, so there is no point in waiting for all the other project to compile, because at the end everything we want to do is fixing the project that does not compile and try again to rebuild).</description></item><item><title>Converting Visual Studio Macro to Visual Studio plugin</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/08/converting-visual-studio-macro-to-visual-studio-plugin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2012 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/08/converting-visual-studio-macro-to-visual-studio-plugin/</guid><description>Visual Studio 2012 is really faster than 2010, this is due to an excellent work of the team to maximize performance and because in this release some of the older and less used part of the IDE were removed.

First: you need to be aware that Remote Debugging Managed Code is only available when you use the authenticated mode, if you run the remote debugger without authentication you can debug only Native Code , but the main problem is that usually the host and remote machine * are not in the same Domain.</description></item><item><title>Customize output windows in Visual Studio</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/01/customize-output-windows-in-visual-studio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2012 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/01/customize-output-windows-in-visual-studio/</guid><description>I really like WPF for showing directly in the Visual Studio Output folder all binding errors, but one annoying stuff is that the output windows is usually crowded with all sort of stuff, so you have an hard life identifying the binding errors from all the other output contained in there.

One of the most interesting capabilities of this tool, is that it is pluggable.
Suppose you have recorded a simple test that verifies the registration procedure for a web site, this test suffer from a well known problem, whenever you will run it, it will try to register the same user again and again and it fails.</description></item><item><title>Productivity power tools navigation</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/07/productivity-power-tools-navigation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2010 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/07/productivity-power-tools-navigation/</guid><description>With Visual Studio 2010 we are expecting a great number on new adding, made possible from the new extension point offered by MEF, and in general with the migration of part of the interface to WPF.

All test projects inside any solution appear as folder, and I was not able anymore to create a test project.

Visual Studio is really a complex and big product, but it is amazing to see how simple it is to write an addin to extend its functionality. First of all we have a dedicated project type for writing an add-in from inside Visual Studio (dogfooding)
Choosing the Visual Studio Add-in a Wizard helps you to decide the type of the addin.The wizard asks for the language to use, and some information, like if the addin should be loaded at startup and if it must be listed under the tools menu.</description></item><item><title>T4 toolbox RenderCore no suitable method to override</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/05/t4-toolbox-rendercore-no-suitable-method-to-override/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2010 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/05/t4-toolbox-rendercore-no-suitable-method-to-override/</guid><description>T4 toolbox a very good Visual Studio addin to efficiently manage T4 template.

This bring me back when I was young, and we have to remember all C stdlib functions because we used vi in linux to edit source file, but in 2010 I&amp;rsquo;m really bad without intellisense.
Ok, I remember very well that SqlConnection has 2 constructors, but for complex classes working without intellisense can be a pain.</description></item><item><title>Coded Ui Test in VS 2010</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/coded-ui-test-in-vs-2010/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2009 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/coded-ui-test-in-vs-2010/</guid><description>I must admit that I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely not a fan of testing through UI. A good program keeps the business logic separated from the UI, so it is testable without passing for the UI. In the real world we have application written by others, or you can simply have to test UI control interaction. In these scenario interacting with the UI can be a viable option.

The most important one is that with VS2010 you will have database project support even with professional edition. You miss some of the advanced features, but you are able to build and deploy database project, and this is really good.
Another point of interest is that Data Dude is installed with TFS build agent, so you do not need to devote one license to the machine where the build agent runs, and this is great.</description></item><item><title>Mvp Team System</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/mvp-team-system/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2009 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/mvp-team-system/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve already announced on my Italian blog, yesterday I received the communication from Microsoft that I awarded a MVP in Team System category.
