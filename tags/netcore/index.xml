&lt;p>This happens because MongoDB driver &amp;gt; 2.8 reference in the chain System.Buffer 4.4.0.

Actually you can reference a dll compiled for DotNetCore from a project that uses full Framework, but in a couple of project we experienced some trouble with some assemblies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Thanks to multitargeting you can simply instruct DotNet compiler to produce libraries compiled against different versions of frameworks,&lt;/strong> so you can simply tell the compiler that you want both DotNetStandard 2.0 and full framework 4.6.1, you just need to modify the project file to use TargetFrameworks tag to request compilation for different framework.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NET core 20 errors installing on linux</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/08/net-core-2-0-errors-installing-on-linux/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2017 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/08/net-core-2-0-errors-installing-on-linux/</guid><description>&lt;p>.NET Core 2.0 is finally out, and I immediately try to install it on every machine and especially in my linux test machines. In one of my Ubuntu machine I got an installation problem, a generic error of apt-get and I was a little bit puzzled on why the installation fail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since in windows the most common cause of.NET Core installation error is the presence of an old package (especially the preview version), I decide to uninstall all previous installation of.NET core on that machine. Luckly enough, doing this on linux is really simple, first of all I list all installed packages that have dotnet in the name&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
