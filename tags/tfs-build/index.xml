Once you have this scenario up and running, releasing your software automatically is quite simple.
Once you automated the installation with a PowerShell script plus an archive file with Everything is needed to install the software, you are only a step away from Continuous Deployment.</description></item><item><title>Monitor if your branch will generate merge conflicts with TFS Build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/11/monitor-if-your-branch-will-generate-merge-conflicts-with-tfs-build/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2014 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/11/monitor-if-your-branch-will-generate-merge-conflicts-with-tfs-build/</guid><description>One of the greatest advantage in using Git over a centralized Version Control System is branching system. It is quite common for developers to start branching whenever they need to add a new feature, work on that branch and finally merge back to mainline when the feature is finished. One of the most famous workflow is called GitFlow, a way to work in Git that is implemented even in some GUI tool like SourceTree.</description></item><item><title>Encrypt your password in TFS Build using Certificates</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/08/encrypt-your-password-in-tfs-build-using-certificates/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 05:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/08/encrypt-your-password-in-tfs-build-using-certificates/</guid><description>Using DPAPI to encrypt password in builds suffers from a serious drawback, the password can be decrypted only by code that runs on the very same computer used to encrypt the password. You can overcome this limitation using roaming profiles, but it is not a option in many scenario. Another technique to enable multiple build servers to decrypt a password is using certificates. In PowerShell is really easy to use a certificate to encrypt/decrypt string and this article will show you how to secure a password in TFS Build definition using Certificates.</description></item><item><title>Tfs build fails with Database Projects</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/02/tfs-build-fails-with-database-projects/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2014 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/02/tfs-build-fails-with-database-projects/</guid><description>If you have a TFS Builds that fails with an error like this one, even if you have installed Visual Studio 2013 on your build server.

How can I store some PowerShell modules “somewhere” and have them available for all Build Agents?
This is a real good question, but sadly enough it has no out-of-the-box answer. Luckily enough you can solve this with a little bit of PowerShell knowledge. Please be aware that this solution is based on some assumption on how TFS build actually works and is not guaranteed to be stable in the future , but I’d like to share with you all if you want to try into your environment.</description></item><item><title>Deploy from a Team Foundation Server build to Web Site without specifying password in the build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/11/deploy-from-a-team-foundation-server-build-to-web-site-without-specifying-password-in-the-build/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Nov 2013 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/11/deploy-from-a-team-foundation-server-build-to-web-site-without-specifying-password-in-the-build/</guid><description>In a previous article I explained how to deploy an ASP.NET Web Site from a TFS Build thanks to MSDeploy engine. One of the great complain you can have with this solution is the need to specify UserName and password in build configuration and the need to use the AllowUntrustedCertificate=true.
The problem of the certificate is the simpler of the two to solve, you just need to use a certificate that is trusted inside your organization or a certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority (es godaddy) , instead of the default one that is generated by MsDeploy configuration in IIS.</description></item><item><title>News in TFS 2013 Build System</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/10/news-in-tfs-2013-build-system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2013 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/10/news-in-tfs-2013-build-system/</guid><description>Team Foundation Server 2013 is finally RTM and it is time to explore some of its new functionalities and see what is changed between previous version.

TFS 2010 build system is based on Workflow Foundation and this means that you can extend writing custom activities (I blogged quite a lot about TFS Build in the past) or using legacy MSBuild actions. With this release you have now 100 new Actions / Activities you can use in your builds as well as a big amount of source code to understand how you can write extensions for Tfs Build System.</description></item><item><title>Getting code coverage result in drop folder during a TFS2010 buils</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/05/getting-code-coverage-result-in-drop-folder-during-a-tfs2010-buils/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2011 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/05/getting-code-coverage-result-in-drop-folder-during-a-tfs2010-buils/</guid><description>In a very old post I explained how to enable code coverage in TFS2010 builds and today I received a mail asking an interesting question.

In this scenario each time you need to deploy a DB project you can create a new build process, edit it, add some customization and finally save and use it for the build.</description></item><item><title>Display complex information in TFS 2010 Build log</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/display-complex-information-in-tfs-2010-build-log/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2010 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/display-complex-information-in-tfs-2010-build-log/</guid><description>If you read this post you learn how to show custom informations in a build, and this is one of the coolest stuff you can do to improve reporting from the buil.

One of the most powerful concept is the ability to use multiple Agents, and the use of Workflow Foundation 4.0 as the orchestrator engine for the build. As a result, you can use one of the basic template or you can build a customized one, just creating or modifying the basic workflow.</description></item><item><title>Moving to a deploy system based on Tfs Build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/08/moving-to-a-deploy-system-based-on-tfs-build/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2010 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/08/moving-to-a-deploy-system-based-on-tfs-build/</guid><description>Now that I&amp;rsquo;m able to deploy to a remote machine a web application thanks to a customized build workflow it is time to move to a real scenario.

To enable code coverage simply open the testsetting file, go to Data And Diagnostics and check the Code coverage option.

The key to achieve this is shadow accounts. I&amp;rsquo;ve installed as an example a build controller in the tfs machine, then I created an agent, and everything runs as BuildAgent account, created in the Tfs Server and added to the Project collection Build Service account.
The next step is creating a user called BuildAgent with the same password of the Tfs Server in another machine, suppose a Windows 7 one.</description></item><item><title>Create web deploy package during a tfs 2010 build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/06/create-web-deploy-package-during-a-tfs-2010-build/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2010 14:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/06/create-web-deploy-package-during-a-tfs-2010-build/</guid><description>Web projects in VS2010 has a great flexibility when it is time to deploy to the server, and it has a great option to generate a Deploy Package with a single click
