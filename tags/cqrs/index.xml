If you look at this simple playground project you can find that we adopted a convention where a domain handler is any object that implements the IDomainHandler marker interface and any public Method that returns void and accepts a single parameter that inherits from the base class DomainEvent is a method handler.</description></item><item><title>SimpleCQRS appliers and convention over configuration</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/06/simplecqrs-appliers-and-convention-over-configuration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jun 2012 14:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/06/simplecqrs-appliers-and-convention-over-configuration/</guid><description>I was playing around with SimpleCQRS project because my friend Andrea started to work on it recently. We now have Mongo repository for the events so I forked the project to have a look on it and contribute to Andrea works. I’ve opened the solution, ran the program, created some InventoryItems, then I look into mongo database to verify if snapshot of objects are correctly taken but I found this.</description></item></channel></rss>
