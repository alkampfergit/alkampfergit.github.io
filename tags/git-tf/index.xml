Usually Git includes a Git svn utility that permits you to clone a subversion locally, use git locally and then finally push commit back to subversion.</description></item><item><title>Git-TF to work with TFS using a local Git repository</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/02/git-tf-to-work-with-tfs-using-a-local-git-repository/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2013 19:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/02/git-tf-to-work-with-tfs-using-a-local-git-repository/</guid><description>Now that TF Service officially supports Git, many people ask themselves if standard TFS VCS is dead?. The answer is clearly no , because a distributed source control is not suitable for all teams / scenario. Anoter reason why standard TFS VCS is not dead is the presence of git-tf (http://gittf.codeplex.com/), a java based tool by Microsoft that permits you to use a TFS VCS but work with Git locally.</description></item></channel></rss>
