&lt;p>Having Git Support in Visual Studio is something I like for a lot of reasons; one of the most important one is the ability to use a &lt;strong>local Git repository even if you work with Standard TFS Source Control or if you work with subversion&lt;/strong>. Usually Git includes a &lt;strong>Git svn utility that permits you to clone a subversion locally, use git locally and then finally push commit back to subversion&lt;/strong>. Microsoft also created a &lt;a href="http://gittf.codeplex.com/">Git-TF&lt;/a> java extension that permits you to clone locally a standard TFS Version Control folder. This means that basically you can use all local goodness of git even if the remote repository is TFVC or Subversion and thanks to VS Plugin you have an unified experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Git-TF to work with TFS using a local Git repository</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/02/git-tf-to-work-with-tfs-using-a-local-git-repository/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2013 19:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/02/git-tf-to-work-with-tfs-using-a-local-git-repository/</guid><description>&lt;p>Now that TF Service officially supports Git, many people ask themselves if &lt;strong>standard TFS VCS is dead?. The answer is clearly no&lt;/strong> , because a distributed source control is not suitable for all teams / scenario. Anoter reason why standard TFS VCS is not dead is the presence of git-tf (&lt;a href="http://gittf.codeplex.com/" title="http://gittf.codeplex.com/">http://gittf.codeplex.com/&lt;/a>), a java based tool by Microsoft that permits you to use a TFS VCS but work with Git locally.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
