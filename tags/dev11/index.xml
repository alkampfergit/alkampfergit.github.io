A key point is being able to communicate easily with Stakeholders and have rapid feedback during each sprint to avoid the risk of “implementing the wrong stuff”.</description></item><item><title>Multi monitor remote desktop on a Windows 7 virtual machine</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/09/multi-monitor-remote-desktop-on-a-windows-7-virtual-machine/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2011 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/09/multi-monitor-remote-desktop-on-a-windows-7-virtual-machine/</guid><description>To test dev 11 preview I’ve setup several virtual machines, just to be sure not to ruin my main installation box, since dev 11 is a developer previewand is not a good idea installing pre-beta release on production machine (even if dev 11 preview is really stable).
One of the annoying stuff in running inside a virtual machine is losing the ability to use all of your monitors… or not? If the virtualized and host operating system are Windows7 or Windows Server 2008, you can connect to the virtual machine using Remote Desktop (remember to enable it on windows7 because is not enabled by default), because it has full support for multiple monitors.</description></item></channel></rss>
