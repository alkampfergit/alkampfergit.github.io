&lt;p>The main problem is that with .NET 8 Microsoft &lt;strong>introduced a concrete and working implementation of Named Dependencies&lt;/strong>, you can &lt;a href="https://weblogs.asp.net/ricardoperes/net-8-dependency-injection-changes-keyed-services">find some details here&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>This is not a tutorial, it is more a repository where I played with API to gain more confidence with &lt;strong>.Net Core version of the API&lt;/strong>.

&lt;p>It turns out that some &lt;strong>clients&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>sometimes used to do HEAD requests&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>and writing to an OutputStream of an HEAD request generates a ProtocolViolationException&lt;/strong> , because the client does not expects content to be returned.

&lt;p>We tend to think that since &lt;strong>disk space is quite cheap in these days&lt;/strong> , it is not a big problem, but this is usually false. Even if we are not worried about performance, having really big databases makes more difficult to manage backups. If you have 1GB Sql Server database, you can use much more easy backup strategy than a situation where you have three database that account for 150GB in total. Time to do a full backup is usually really &lt;em>high&lt;/em>, time to restore a database is even higher and these are only few of the problem that you will start to face on production server. For performance we can buy really fast hardware (after all it is production hardware so it worth spend on it) and we can reach good performance even with such big databases.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Change the icon of a folder</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/04/change-the-icon-of-a-folder/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2011 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/04/change-the-icon-of-a-folder/</guid><description>&lt;p>I need to change the default icon of Windows Explorer for some special folder inside a my application, I know that it could be done Through Desktop.Ini file, but after some frustrating tentative I did not succeed in using a custom.ico file stored as resource inside the assembly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve started programming on a Vic20 Commodore computer, I began just with copying a couple of programs that are in the manual, and immediately being curious about the &lt;em>Basic&lt;/em> language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I moved to a Vic20 programming course in Cassette and this was the very first thing that amazed me, the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m able to record a program on a audio cassette, I believed that they could be used only for music. I realize now, how many years are passed. After the course I was a &lt;em>Basic programmer&lt;/em> :P, being able to manage memory with Peek and Poke and started realizing some little programs. My first programs are full of GOTO and were really &lt;em>spaghetti code&lt;/em>, but when I began high school I moved to Pascal, and I began to learn how to give better structure to my programs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Change base directory of a site in IIS</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/change-base-directory-of-a-site-in-iis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2009 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/change-base-directory-of-a-site-in-iis/</guid><description>&lt;p>This technique works for IIS6 and IIS7 with the &amp;ldquo;IIS 6 WMI Compatibility* installed.
