Thanks to mms I can simply start the upgrade process directly from a web page, without needing to have an access to my real servers. The real good stuff is that the upgrade process is completely managed by mms for me, and the upgrade is done without stopping my Replica Set.</description></item><item><title>Upgrade your agents and instances with Mms</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/11/upgrade-your-agents-and-instances-with-mms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2014 14:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/11/upgrade-your-agents-and-instances-with-mms/</guid><description>Another big advantages of using MMS to manage your mongo deployments is the ability to automatic upgrade agents and instances. For agents you can simply open the deployment area of a group and select edit mode. If some agent is outdated, the interface will immediately warn you with an alert on the top of the page as you can see in Figure 1.

Mms is not only useful to deploy mongo instances, but it is exceptional also for monitoring and configuring. One of the most interesting features is managing users easily from mms web interface. Suppose you had installed mongo on an Azure Virtual Machine and you do not want everyone being able to access your instance. A possible solution is enabling authentication.</description></item></channel></rss>
