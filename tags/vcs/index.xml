This lead to a tremendous improvement in performance with very big repository. Actually doing an update from my SSD on a project that has thousands of folder is almost instantaneous. Just install the new version of tortoise, update the local workspace and you are done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>News for TFS 11 VCS</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/08/news-for-tfs-11-vcs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Aug 2011 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/08/news-for-tfs-11-vcs/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2011/08/02/version-control-model-enhancements-in-tfs-11.aspx">this post of Mr. Brian Harry&lt;/a> some of the news regarding TFS 11 VCS are unveiled. While there is still no DVCS, there are a lot of improvements with the introduction of &lt;em>local workspaces&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Actually TFS Workspaces status is kept on the server, so whenever you issue a GetLatest, the server check the status of the Workspace and send you only new data. This causes sometimes behavior that surprise most developer coming from other VCS like subversion. One of this surprising behavior is &lt;em>delete a file from the file system, then issue a Get Latest, the file is not downloaded again&lt;/em>. This happens because the server does not know that you deleted the file, he still thinks that the file is there so you need to do a Get Specific version, or issue a &lt;a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c255a1e4-04ba-4f68-8f4e-cd473d6b971f">tfpt scorch&lt;/a> command. Another aspect developers do not like is having Read-only file that needs to be checked out before starting to work with.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Idiomatic VCS usage</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/04/idiomatic-vcs-usage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2011 14:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/04/idiomatic-vcs-usage/</guid><description>&lt;p>When it is time to compare two &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">VCS&lt;/a> there are a lot of features to be taken into account, and in my opinion one of the most important is &lt;em>the team is already used to some VCS?&lt;/em>. One of the most difficult part of learning a new VCS, is avoiding to use it in the same way you use a different product, because each VCS could potentially have a different way to do the same thing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
