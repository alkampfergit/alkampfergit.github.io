I’ve spent almost 10 minutes to find why my netsh rule is not working (I work with a user that is not administrator of the machine) and finally, by frustration I opened Visual Studio with administrator user, just to verify that the error is still there.</description></item><item><title>Release software with GitHub actions and GitVersion</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2020/03/github-actions-plus-gitversion/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2020 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2020/03/github-actions-plus-gitversion/</guid><description>One of the nice aspect of GitHub actions is that you can automate stuff simply with command line tools. If you want to do continuous release of your software and you want to use GitVersion tool to determine a unique SemVer version from the history, here is the sequence of steps.
Iinstall/update gitversion tool with commandline tools Run GitVersio to determine SemVer numbers Issue a standard build/test using SemVerNumbers of step 2 If tests are ok, use dotnet publish command (with SemVer numbers) to publish software Zip and upload publish result It the branch is Master publish a GitHub release of your software.</description></item><item><title>Publish artifacts in GitHub actions</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2020/03/publish-artifacts-in-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2020/03/publish-artifacts-in-github-actions/</guid><description>GitHub action is perfect to automate simple build workflow and can also be used to publish “releases” of our software. While we can do actions to publish on cloud or elsewhere, what I appreciate from a tool is: allow me to make simple things with simple workflow. While I appreciate being able to obtain complex result and indeed, sometimes we evaluate products on the ability to fulfill complex scenario, often we forgot about the simple things.</description></item><item><title>How to configure Visual Studio as Diff and Merge tool for Git</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2019/07/how-to-configure-visual-studio-as-diff-and-merge-tool-for-git/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2019 12:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2019/07/how-to-configure-visual-studio-as-diff-and-merge-tool-for-git/</guid><description>After almost six years, the post on How to configure diff and merge tool in Visual Studio Git Tools is still read by people that found it useful, but it is now really really old and needs to be updated.

The only problem you have in this scenario is that, sometimes, you need some prerequisites installed on the build machine, like MongoDb and they are missing on hosted build.
Lets take as use case NStore, an open source library for Event Sourcing in C# that needs to run unit test against MongoDb and SqlServer, prerequisites that are not present in Linux Hosted Agents.</description></item><item><title>Import Work Item from external system to Azure DevOps</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2019/01/import-work-item-from-external-system-to-azure-devops/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jan 2019 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2019/01/import-work-item-from-external-system-to-azure-devops/</guid><description>In previous post I’ve dealt with exporting Work Item information in Word file with AzureDevOps API, now I want to deal with the inverse operation, importing data from external service into Azure DevOps.

This will guarantee that the solution actually compiles correctly and all the tests run perfectly, even in Linux environment. If you are 100% sure that, if a dotnetcore project runs fine under Windows it should run fine under Linux, you will have some interesting surprises. The first and trivial difference is that Linux filesystem is case sensitive.</description></item><item><title>Error in WSUS after Windows Update KB3148812</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/04/error-in-wsus-after-windows-update-kb3148812/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/04/error-in-wsus-after-windows-update-kb3148812/</guid><description>I have a test lab with a Windows Server 2012 R2 domain controller, and one of the feature I like the most is WSUS, that allows me to spin of an update new Virtual Machines without the need to wait for all Windows Update to be downloaded from the Internet.

The fundamental step to obtain a good logging infrastructure, is to use one of the libraries available in the open source world, and probably you will end using log4net because it is really good. One of the most important characteristic of a good infrastructure for logging is the ability to change the destination of logs without recompiling, and the possibility to extend the basic logging facility with custom destination storage.</description></item><item><title>svcutil and the infamous This URL does not support DISCO</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/11/svcutil-and-the-infamous-this-url-does-not-support-disco/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2008 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/11/svcutil-and-the-infamous-this-url-does-not-support-disco/</guid><description>WCF is undoubtedly a complex beast, and sometimes you gets stuck on some strange errors.

This is a really standard way to work, since when you are enumerating a sequence, if you add or remove an element, the sequence is changed and the whole enumeration operation should be aborted. This behaviour can be frustrating, because quite often I need to iterate through a dictionary object, and I want to be able to remove some element depending on some condition, but I cannot use a foreach beacuse I cannot modify the dictionary while enumerating.</description></item><item><title>A good log can really helps you to write better application</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/09/a-good-log-can-really-helps-you-to-write-better-application/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2008 05:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/09/a-good-log-can-really-helps-you-to-write-better-application/</guid><description>Actually I&amp;rsquo;m working on a project that have a windows service that does a lot of calculation, invokes external servers, and stuff like these.

The most important problem with different indentation or layout scheme, is that when you press the magic CTRL+K CTRL+D you reformat the source code with your layout scheme, when you use winmerge or similar tool to find differencies between the various version in a source control you find often that all the file is changed…because of the layout.</description></item><item><title>Desktop Space</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/04/desktop-space/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2008 23:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/04/desktop-space/</guid><description>I was always astonished when I think to the evolution of pc.
