&lt;p>AS you can see I can launch visual studio 2010 from my main machine, but it runs inside a virtual pc virtual machine. This is fantastic because you do not have to worry about anything, just launch it and it runs like it was installed on your sistem, except from little details, like the windows bar.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
