Figure 1: A stupid web page to sum two numbers
WOW, this is really a beautiful and useful web page :), now I want to register a web performance test that is able to use extraction rules to use this page as a Fibonacci Number calculator. I start registering a simple web performance test that adds 1 and 2 together.</description></item><item><title>Extending Visual Studio 2010 Web Test-Regex extraction</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/extending-visual-studio-2010-web-testregex-extraction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2010 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/extending-visual-studio-2010-web-testregex-extraction/</guid><description>In a previous post I showed how to create a custom loop that permits you to create a loop in a web performance test to iterate from the char ‘a&amp;rsquo; to char ‘z&amp;rsquo;, now I want to be able to create an inner loop that

One of the most interesting capabilities of this tool, is that it is pluggable.
Suppose you have recorded a simple test that verifies the registration procedure for a web site, this test suffer from a well known problem, whenever you will run it, it will try to register the same user again and again and it fails.</description></item></channel></rss>
