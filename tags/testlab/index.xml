The most important step was always running the TfsCongfig ChangeServerId Command as described in the Move Team Foundation Server from your hardware configuration to another.

The problem is caused by the NIC firmare that is not compatible with Server 2012 R2. Luckly enough, HP just released a patch of the firmware to address this problem, you can find more info in the last post of this thread.</description></item></channel></rss>
