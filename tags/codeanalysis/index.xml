The question is: Is it possible to have Code Coverage result to be included in drop folder?.
Answering this question is a two phase process, the first one is understanding where MsTest store results of code coverage and verify that is possible to do something useful with them.</description></item><item><title>Code analysis for Sql Project</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/code-analysis-for-sql-project/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2009 23:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/code-analysis-for-sql-project/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a fanatic of Code Analysis, at least I know that it is quite impractical trying to remove all warning of fxcop analysis, but I strongly advice you to run code analysis on your code, and give it a shot from time to time. First of all is a good way to find potential bug, then you will always learn new and more standard way to write your code.</description></item></channel></rss>
