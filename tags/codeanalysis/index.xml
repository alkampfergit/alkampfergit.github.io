&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The question is: &lt;em>Is it possible to have Code Coverage result to be included in drop folder?&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Answering this question is a two phase process, the first one is understanding where MsTest store results of code coverage and verify that is possible to do something useful with them. The answer is simple, you can simply look at the TestResult directory after you execute tests inside visual studio, and you will find a data.coverage file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Code analysis for Sql Project</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/code-analysis-for-sql-project/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2009 23:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/code-analysis-for-sql-project/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not a fanatic of Code Analysis, at least I know that it is quite impractical trying to remove all warning of fxcop analysis, but I strongly advice you to run code analysis on your code, and give it a shot from time to time. First of all is a good way to find potential bug, then you will always learn new and more standard way to write your code.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
