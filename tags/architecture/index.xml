I previously described a scenario where the customer needs a really basic Request Response service in WCF, the goal is being able to take advantage of a request / response structure, but with an approach like: “the simpliest thing that could possibly works”. This technique is usually needed to introduce new architectural concepts in a team without requiring people to learn a huge amount of concepts in a single shot, a scenario that could ends in a team that actively * fight the new architecture because it is too complex *.</description></item><item><title>Reason behind a request 8211 response service in WCF</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/reson-behind-request-responseservice-in-wc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Apr 2012 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/reson-behind-request-responseservice-in-wc/</guid><description>I dealt with a minimal implementation of a basic Request Response WCF Service some times ago, now it is time to show some advantages you have using this approach. If the caller is created in.NET technology, you can directly reference the dll that contains all Requests and responses , without the need to create a service reference in Visual Studio. In my example the service is called CoreService, so I created a CoreServiceClient class to implement communication from client to server.</description></item><item><title>Basic Request Response WCF service</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/basic-request-response-wcf-service/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Mar 2012 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/basic-request-response-wcf-service/</guid><description>The concept of Request-Response service is to have an endpoint with a single function capable to handle a command (a Request) and return a Response, to have a single entry point of our service. There are a lot of architectures around the web based on WCF and this pattern and this old series of post are a really good example on how you can implement it in practice.
The only drawback is that sometimes these architectures are quite complex for the average programmer, at least you can introduce them in a team where everyone is quite familiar with concept of Inversion Of Control, Dependency Injection, etc etc.</description></item><item><title>Using a state object to store object property values</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/11/using-a-state-object-to-store-object-property-values/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2011 18:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/11/using-a-state-object-to-store-object-property-values/</guid><description>In an old post I dealt with a possible implementation of a BaseEntity class that stores all properties in a State object (based on a dictionary to store properties). Technically speaking, this solution have no drawbacks respect using field variables to store properties values, but it can give a lot of benefit. If you see the object from the outside, it presents a bunch of properties and thanks to encapsulation you can use the technique you prefer to store the real data inside the object.</description></item><item><title>Square peg in a round Hole</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/10/square-peg-in-a-round-hole/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2011 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/10/square-peg-in-a-round-hole/</guid><description>After lots of year working with NHibernate I started to think that probably the whole concept of ORM can be considered an Antipattern. Some people prefer a “classic” approach to the problem, * data *is the key concept and most of the logic is inside a storage based on Relational Model.
Is this wrong?
Absolutely not, after all, for many years this was the preferred way to structure your application, and it worked quite well, but after OOP has come to life, a lot of people started appreciating this new paradigm of programming and started to think in terms of “ objects ” instead of “ data ”.</description></item><item><title>Leverage the concept of 'state' of your entities</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/leverage-the-concept-of-state-of-your-entities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2011 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/leverage-the-concept-of-state-of-your-entities/</guid><description>One of the interesting ideas found in Radical and other implementations of DDD architectures, is implementing properties of Domain objects in a slightly different way from the standard, using something like a dictionary to store values of properties. When we want to implement a property for a Domain class you usually end up with similar code.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 public String Property { get; set; } private string _fieldBasedProperty; public String FieldBasedProperty { get { return _fieldBasedProperty; } set { _fieldBasedProperty = value; } } Both of them use a private field to store the real value of the property, the first one is a compact form (I to not like it for Domain object because it gives you no control on state changing of the object), the second one is the standard code to implement a property with a Backing field.</description></item><item><title>Lifecycle of singleton objects</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/05/lifecycle-of-singleton-objects/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2011 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/05/lifecycle-of-singleton-objects/</guid><description>Some days ago I blogged about an implementation of persistent cache component based on Managed Esent and PersistentDictionary. This component is injected into other components thanks to Inversion of Control and it is a Singleton object.
Being a singleton is a requisite because it permits to different dependent objects to share the same cache, moreover PersistentDictionary does not permit to have multiple instances that insists on the same directory. This will make EsentCache a perfect candidate of Singleton Object Pattern.</description></item><item><title>Mock Service Locator and Automocking Container to the rescue</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/10/mock-service-locator-and-automocking-container-to-the-rescue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2010 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/10/mock-service-locator-and-automocking-container-to-the-rescue/</guid><description>In a previous post I dealt on how to write an AutoMockingContainer that is able to resolve a mock for unregistered objects. The goal was to be able to circumvent the problem of service locator.
Figure 1: During a test, the real container of the service locator is substituted with an AutoMocking container.
This is a standard way to work when you have to test classes that depends from Service Locator, override the Service Locator for the test, making it returns stub.</description></item><item><title>Mock Service Locator Automocking container and the hard life of testers</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/10/mock-service-locator-automocking-container-and-the-hard-life-of-testers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2010 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/10/mock-service-locator-automocking-container-and-the-hard-life-of-testers/</guid><description>I know, service locator is an antipattern, but sometimes, when you begin to refactor existing code written with no IoC in mind, service locator can help you a little bit in restructuring your code. A service locator pattern work this way: you have some static or gloablly avaliable class named: ServiceLocator or IoC, and every object can query it for service implementation.

This windows does not communicate nothing to the user, moreover if you click ok nothing happens&amp;hellip; skype continue to work with no problem.

The question mark means that you are not sure if your new deploy is really ok, because maybe some of the scheduled tasks will fail for misconfiguration or something else.</description></item><item><title>Wise architects</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/12/wise-architects/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2009 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/12/wise-architects/</guid><description>Software architects are similar to civil architects, both of them work to create an artifact (software or building) on paper that will be subsequent realized. If you are committed to make a project of a building, witch of them you will like more to create?
I&amp;rsquo;m sure that the first one is probably the first choice, for many reasons. It is more challenging, it will probably make you famous, it is surely more beautiful.</description></item><item><title>Writing modular software with castle</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/09/writing-modular-software-with-castle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2009 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/09/writing-modular-software-with-castle/</guid><description>Thanks to Castle Windsor you can write really modular software. I&amp;rsquo;m building a project in WinForm that needs to access the domain model through a service layer on a WS* service. One of the most annoying stuff is the need to setup a local service to test the application and the interface.
The key to speedup development is writing high modular software, thanks to castle this is really simple. First of all I use guardian facility to create proxy.</description></item></channel></rss>
