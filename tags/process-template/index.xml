&lt;p>In previous post I did a brief introduction to the concept of States and Transitions of Work Items and it is time to do a little deep dive to understand how you can configure complex rules on transition between states. Lets introduce a new rule for our bug definition: &lt;font color="#0000ff">&lt;strong>we want to be able to move from the &lt;em>Triage &lt;/em>state to &lt;em>Closed&lt;/em>, only if the user is an administrator of the team project&lt;/strong>&lt;/font>. This is a quite standard requirement because going from Triage to Closed basically means: &lt;em>“ignore that bug”&lt;/em> and only an administrators should be able to take such a decision.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Customize State and Transitions of a Work Item</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/customize-state-and-transitions-of-a-work-item/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2011 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/customize-state-and-transitions-of-a-work-item/</guid><description>&lt;p>1 – &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2011/06/22/customize-tfs-process-template/">Customize Tfs Process Template&lt;/a>&lt;br>

&lt;p>Now that we know how to add information to a Work Item definition, it is time to deal with “state” management. Each Work Item has a field called * &lt;strong>Status&lt;/strong> *that is completely different from any other field, because has an associated workflow that manages transactions from various allowed status values. Having a workflow to manage State of a Work Item is a really powerful concept, because permits a more accurate modeling of your process. As an example suppose that in your process each bug enter the system in a status called *&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_triage#Bug_management">Triage&lt;/a>,*because is new and need to be examined by someone before a developer could actually work to its resolution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interesting rules to customize Work Items</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/interesting-rules-to-customize-work-items/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2011 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/interesting-rules-to-customize-work-items/</guid><description>&lt;p>1 – &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2011/06/22/customize-tfs-process-template/">Customize Tfs Process Template&lt;/a>&lt;br>

&lt;p>In fourth chapter we familiarized with Rules and how you can customize a Work Items adding rules to it. You can find a complete list of &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms194953%28v=VS.100%29.aspx">Rules at this link&lt;/a>, but I want to show you the most useful ones (at least in my opinion).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Basic of TFS Process Template customization</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/basic-of-tfs-process-template-customization/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2011 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/basic-of-tfs-process-template-customization/</guid><description>&lt;p>1 – &lt;a href="http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2011/06/22/customize-tfs-process-template/">Customize Tfs Process Template&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the first post I showed how to download the definition of a process template into a local folder and how to open it with the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb980963">Process Template Editor&lt;/a>; in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show you some of the very basic customizations that you can do with the PTE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Methodology section you can simply change the name of the Process Template as well as including a textual description. Remember that if you do not change the name, when you upload the modified version you will overwrite the original PT, so if you are planning to create a modified version of some basic template, you need to change the name first.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Customize TFS Process Template</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/customize-tfs-process-template/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2011 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/customize-tfs-process-template/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the best aspect of TFS is that it is customizable: we can interact with API, customize builds, handle events and many other interaction, but one of the most important is the ability to customize the &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718795">process template.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.gorpal.com/Resources/Images/BridgingGap.jpg"> &lt;img src="http://www.gorpal.com/Resources/Images/BridgingGap.jpg" alt="External Image" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This capability is fundamental, because permit to adapt TFS to own process, the mantra is ** &lt;strong>do not adapt your process to the tool, but adapt the tool to your process&lt;/strong> **. The purpose of an ALM tool is to support your own process, not to force the team to shape itself just to conform to the tool. The ability of a tool to adapt itself to the scenario is the key factor in choosing between various alternative. If you need a wrench you can buy the left one, that works only for a couple of bolt dimension, or you can buy the right one that is adaptable to various bolt&amp;rsquo;s dimension.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
