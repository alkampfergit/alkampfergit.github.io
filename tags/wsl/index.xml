In a WSL2 instance you are running inside a Virtual Environment managed by your Windows Operating system, and the greatest advantage is the ability to work with a unified filesystem and being able to have a great communication between the two system. This is perfect but I have a small problem, if I want to use the WSL2 instance to test some software I&amp;rsquo;m developing I&amp;rsquo;d like to access services running on my host operating system.</description></item></channel></rss>
