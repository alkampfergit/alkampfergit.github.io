&lt;p>With version 4 it added a really cool capability called &lt;a href="http://www.ndepend.com/doc_cqlinq_features.aspx">CQLinq&lt;/a> or Code Query Linq; an amazing feature that permits you to query your code using LINQ stile queries. Basically after I’ve analyzed a solution I got presented with a simple dialog that asked me what I’m interested to do primarily with the result of the analysis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ndepend to the resque</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/ndepend-to-the-resque/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2010 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/ndepend-to-the-resque/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve blogged about this supersimple but amazing feature of NDepend some time ago, but I want to emphasize another time how NDepend is a tool that you must have in your toolset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve deployed an application with click-once, but when I try to install it &amp;hellip; I got this error&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/image2.png">&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/image_thumb2.png"> &lt;img src="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/image_thumb2.png" alt="image" />&lt;/a>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Figure 1&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>: &lt;em>The error during the installation&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the error is strange, the application requires an assembly with a wrong version, because the system.runtime.serialization should be 3.0.0.0. Now in a solution with 55 project&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;what is the project with the wrong reference?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NDepend 30 a must have tool</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/05/ndepend-3-0-a-must-have-tool/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 May 2010 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/05/ndepend-3-0-a-must-have-tool/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m exploring the new capabilities of NDepend 3.0, and the very first interesting stuff is that I&amp;rsquo;m now able in VS2010 to add a NDepend project to the solution, so I&amp;rsquo;m able to manage ndepend project properties inside from VS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/image13.png">&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/image_thumb13.png"> &lt;img src="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/image_thumb13.png" alt="image" />&lt;/a>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can drag and drop project inside the windows to add and remove project from the analysis, and this is very productive. After you run the analysis you can navigate into the result, as an example you can choose from the NDepend menu the CQL explorer&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A quick look at NDepend</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/05/a-quick-look-at-ndepend/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2010 12:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/05/a-quick-look-at-ndepend/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.ndepend.com/">NDepend&lt;/a> is a must have tool for people that manages seriously.NET projects, because it give you an overwhelming amount of information and metrics with few clicks. A complete tour of NDepend is really difficult to do, but I want to highlight what you got when you analyze a complex project, because NDepend can really save you a lot of troubles :).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After you load an entire project you can immediately see errors and warning&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
