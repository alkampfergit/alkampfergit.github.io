With version 4 it added a really cool capability called CQLinq or Code Query Linq; an amazing feature that permits you to query your code using LINQ stile queries. Basically after I’ve analyzed a solution I got presented with a simple dialog that asked me what I’m interested to do primarily with the result of the analysis.</description></item><item><title>Ndepend to the resque</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/ndepend-to-the-resque/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2010 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/ndepend-to-the-resque/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve blogged about this supersimple but amazing feature of NDepend some time ago, but I want to emphasize another time how NDepend is a tool that you must have in your toolset.

I can drag and drop project inside the windows to add and remove project from the analysis, and this is very productive. After you run the analysis you can navigate into the result, as an example you can choose from the NDepend menu the CQL explorer</description></item><item><title>A quick look at NDepend</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/05/a-quick-look-at-ndepend/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2010 12:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/05/a-quick-look-at-ndepend/</guid><description>NDepend is a must have tool for people that manages seriously.NET projects, because it give you an overwhelming amount of information and metrics with few clicks. A complete tour of NDepend is really difficult to do, but I want to highlight what you got when you analyze a complex project, because NDepend can really save you a lot of troubles :).
After you load an entire project you can immediately see errors and warning</description></item></channel></rss>
