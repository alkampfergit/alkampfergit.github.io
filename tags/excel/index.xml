I have my personal account on VSTS, always updated to the latest version, but I have also customer that still uses TFS 2012 or TFS 2010.
Microsoft test newer version of TFS against lots of applications to be sure that newer versions of TFS do not break usage of existing tools.</description></item><item><title>Team foundation server and excel</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/team-foundation-server-and-excel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2009 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/team-foundation-server-and-excel/</guid><description>One of the greatest features of Tfs is that it is a single product that is able to manage the whole ALM of an application, but another strength point is high level of integration with other tools. One of the coolest feature is the ability to use Excel to manage workitems, without the need to even open visual studio.
It is enough for you to install the team exploer, and you will get office integration.</description></item></channel></rss>
