I have my personal account on VSTS, always updated to the latest version, but I have also customer that still uses TFS 2012 or TFS 2010.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft test newer version of TFS against lots of applications to be sure that &lt;strong>newer versions of TFS do not break usage of existing tools.&lt;/strong> This means that usually you can upgrade your TFS without worrying that your VS 2010 or Visual Basic 6 stops working. You need to be aware that the opposite is not true. This imply that &lt;strong>newer version of Visual Studio could not work well with older version of TFS&lt;/strong>. This decision is done because Microsoft is encouraging people to keep their TFS installation up to date, and it would be a nightmare to always guarantee that newer tools would be able to communicate with the older service API.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Team foundation server and excel</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/team-foundation-server-and-excel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2009 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/08/team-foundation-server-and-excel/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the greatest features of Tfs is that it is a single product that is able to manage the whole ALM of an application, but another strength point is high level of integration with other tools. One of the coolest feature is the ability to use Excel to manage workitems, without the need to even open visual studio.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is enough for you to install the team exploer, and you will get office integration. Excel shows a new tab in the ribbon named &lt;em>Team&lt;/em> that permits you to work with team foundation server. You can choose item specifying a standard workitem query, or you can directly create new workitem or load by id. As an example you can view all opened bugs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
