For all those readers that does not know what a symbol server is, I suggest to read my previous article that explains how to manage a symbol server on Azure or on-premises VM with TFS and IIS.
Recently I’ve got some feedback from people that were not able to setup everything correctly when is time to expose Symbol Server with IIS.</description></item><item><title>Deploy AspNET web site on IIS from TFS Build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/08/deploy-asp-net-web-site-on-iis-from-tfs-build/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2013 05:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/08/deploy-asp-net-web-site-on-iis-from-tfs-build/</guid><description>In the last article of the series, I dealt with Deploying on Azure Web Sites from on-premise TFS, but the very same technique can be used to automatically deploy from a standard TFS Build to a standard Web Site hosted in IIS and not in Azure. For this demo I’ve prepared a VM on azure, but the configuration is the very same if the VM is on-premise or if you use a physical machine to run IIS.</description></item></channel></rss>
