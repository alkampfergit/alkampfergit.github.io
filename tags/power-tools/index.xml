This question arose during a talk about how to handle the lifecycle of a bug, and when it was time to deal with the “avoid duplication” issue, people told me that they want a simple way to search work item by text, because this is the fastest way to verify if a bug has some duplicate.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Team Foundation Server power tools December release</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/12/team-foundation-server-power-tools-december-release/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2011 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/12/team-foundation-server-power-tools-december-release/</guid><description>&lt;p>You can read &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2011/12/16/december-2011-tfs-power-tools-release.aspx">all the details Here&lt;/a>, but basically it is a release mainly focused for “non visual studio developers”. This new release has a MSSCCI provider for 64 bit, and a version of Power Tools for eclipse, and it is available from the Eclipse update site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those ones interested in knowing the news for VS Power Tools, basically it add the capability to search for number in the “Work Item Search Box” and a bunch of rules in the Best Practice Analyzer to identify issues with Project Server interaction, so, for Visual Studio Users it is a minor release, and probably the last for Visual Studio 2010, as stated by Brian&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TFS Pills merging conflicts during unshelve</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/12/tfs-pills-merging-conflicts-during-unshelve/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2011 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/12/tfs-pills-merging-conflicts-during-unshelve/</guid><description>&lt;p>Shelvesets are a really useful concept in TFS, and you should be aware that thanks to Power Tools you can even do a Merge during an Unshelve in case of conflicts. As an example suppose this simple and stupid scenario, you have this code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image8.png">&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image_thumb8.png"> &lt;img src="https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image_thumb8.png" alt="image" />&lt;/a>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now lets generate a conflict with Shelveset; simply typing some text.&lt;/p>

This needs is especially important for addin like Custom Check-in policies, because if developers do not install check-in policies they would not be run during a Check-in. Every time you show check-in policies to a customer, it immediately ask you how to distribute them to all developers pc automatically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found that some people are not aware that such a feature is already there, but is included in TFS power tools, so it is not available out of the box with a plain installation of Visual Studio and TFS. After installing power tools you can simply right click in the Team Members node and choose Personal Settings&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
