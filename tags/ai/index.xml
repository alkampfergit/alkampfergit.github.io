The more freedom given to the model, the more the result can deviate from your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using a model to help write detailed specifications is an easy way to accomplish this. This allows you to quickly generate good, detailed specs that you can manually refine. I often use various models with Open Web UI for this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that Claude Code offers agents, and creating an agent is simple, I immediately tried creating agents to automate this process. The results are promising, but not perfect. Claude Code seems focused on writing code and tends to over-deliver. Starting with a simple idea and asking Claude Code to create an agent for brainstorming detailed specifications yields good results, but how good are they?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Call o3-pro in Azure OpenAI using C# SDK</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/ai/call-o3-pro-with-csharp-sdk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/ai/call-o3-pro-with-csharp-sdk/</guid><description>&lt;p>Azure OpenAI supports now o3-pro model. This model is different from other ones, here is a brief summary of its advantages: &lt;em>The o3-pro model excels at advanced reasoning, delivers high accuracy, supports long-context tasks, and integrates powerful tools like web search and code execution. Itâ€™s cost-effective, reliable, and ideal for complex workflows in research, business, and creative fields.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find tons of example on how you can call Azure OpenAI models with C# Nuget Package but &lt;strong>o3-pro is a slightly different beast&lt;/strong>. The usual problem is you will use existing code and you got this error.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GitHub Copilot Workspace: first impression</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/ai/gh-copilot-workspace-first-impression/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/ai/gh-copilot-workspace-first-impression/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have the luck to have enabled the technical preview of &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2024-04-29-github-copilot-workspace/">Github Copilot Workspace&lt;/a>. As every good developer, I immediately jump at it, without reading anything (spoiler you have a good &lt;a href="https://github.com/githubnext/copilot-workspace-user-manual">user manual&lt;/a>) that can be used to &lt;strong>move your first steps into this marvelous world&lt;/strong>. Not reading the documentation is for me a good way to start using it and verify &lt;strong>how intuitive is the tool and what it can do into a real project&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introductory video playlist about Semantic Kernel RC</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/ai/introduction-to-semantic-kernel-rc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/ai/introduction-to-semantic-kernel-rc/</guid><description>&lt;p>Semantic Kernel reached Release Candidate and there are some breaking changes from the latest beta. For this reason I re-recorded a series of video I&amp;rsquo;ve planned a couple of week ago with all examples updated to RC3.&lt;/p>
