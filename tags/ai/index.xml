For this reason I re-recorded a series of video I&amp;rsquo;ve planned a couple of week ago with all examples updated to RC3.
Here is the list on my youtube channel: Semantic Kernel Playlist
Call python function from C# - How you can call python code from C# to simplify interaction with LLM or other Models Using new Handlebar templates - How to interact with a LLM (GPT in this example) with classic chat mode Create plugins in C# - How to Create plugin in C# and call directly through kernel object AutoPluginInvoker capabilities - Let Semantic Kernel automatically invoke plugin if needed during your chat interaction with GPT All the videos are in my youtube channel.</description></item><item><title>Using GPT-4 to Create a Small Software Project from Specification</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/ai/super-ai-wizard/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/ai/super-ai-wizard/</guid><description>As a programmer, I often find myself seeking ways to expedite the initial stages of a software development project. GPT-4 has become a valuable tool in this regard, as it can help generate the foundational code for a new project. By leveraging the power of this advanced AI language model, I can significantly reduce the time and effort required for setting up a project, thus allowing me to focus on more complex aspects of the development process.</description></item></channel></rss>
