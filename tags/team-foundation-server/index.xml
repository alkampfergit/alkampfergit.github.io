Figure 1: General Service Unavailable error for TFS Web interface
This error happens most of the time if you have wrong user credentials in the worker process used by IIS to run the TFS Application.

Some people are surprised because after TFS 2015 we had TFS 2017 and we are still in 2017 and we already have version 2018, but this is the good part of the ALM tools in Microsoft, they are really shipping tons of new goodness each year :).
Release note page contains all the details about the new version, from that link you have a small 13 minute video that explain what is new in this version and as usual in the page you have a detailed list of all the news with detailed information about each of the new features.</description></item><item><title>Visual Studio 2010 error connecting to TFS 2017</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/05/visual-studio-2010-error-connecting-to-tfs-2017/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2017 15:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/05/visual-studio-2010-error-connecting-to-tfs-2017/</guid><description>One of the reason why I always suggest of keeping TFS upgraded is the compatibility matrix. Microsoft ensure that old tools (like VS 2010) always can connect to latest version of TFS, but the opposite is not true. This means that new version of Visual Studio could have problem connecting to older instances of TFS.
Keeping your TFS updated will guarantee that you can use TFS with newer and older tooling (yes, even Visual Basic 6 can work with TFS 2017)</description></item><item><title>Create a Team Project from Web UI in TFS 2015 Update 2</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/04/create-a-team-project-from-web-ui-in-tfs-2015-update-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2016 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/04/create-a-team-project-from-web-ui-in-tfs-2015-update-2/</guid><description>Creation of a new Team Project is a feature that traditionally was available only from Visual Studio in TFS on-premises. You do not need to have a full Visual Studio installation, you can only install the Team Explorer component, but in 2015, unfortunately, the stand alone installer for Team Explorer is Gone.
It turns out that, after upgrade to 2015 you should install Visual Studio Express or Visual Studio Community to create a Team Project.</description></item><item><title>Tfx error Failed to find api location for area</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/11/tfx-error-failed-to-find-api-location-for-area/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2015 21:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/11/tfx-error-failed-to-find-api-location-for-area/</guid><description>Tfx-cli is a cross platform command line for TFS / VSTS that can be used to accomplish various tasks.

Figure 1: Task estimation is made in hours.
Using hours is only a matter of convenience, but many agile team does not like hourly estimates and prefer using some other empirical values such as Effort, Story Points, or Cup Of Coffee, where the latter is the number of Cup Of Coffee you need to finish that task :) (dev are caffeine addicted).</description></item><item><title>Change email address in TFSPReview</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/10/change-email-address-in-tfspreview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2012 21:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/10/change-email-address-in-tfspreview/</guid><description>Actually TFSservice only accepts live id as a login mechanism, but if you start to use it in your company probably you want it to use another email address for E-Mail communication (alert, Feedback, etc), this is possible through the My Profile link

Even if this seems only a simple and stupid change, it shows one of the advantage of using TfsService over having it on-premise: the automatic update process made periodically by Microsoft. The change in the login page is only a fancy change of an update that was deployed last week on TFS Service, this actually means two distinct advantage:</description></item><item><title>Install Sharepoint Foundation on Workstation error the user does not exists or is not unique</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/install-sharepoint-foundation-on-workstation-error-the-user-does-not-exists-or-is-not-unique/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2012 19:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/install-sharepoint-foundation-on-workstation-error-the-user-does-not-exists-or-is-not-unique/</guid><description>I wish to install Sharepoint Foundation 2010 on a Single Workstation machine (Windows Server 2008 R2) to use with TFS11 Beta and I followed the really good guide of my friend Giuseppe Marchi to accomplish this task, but I got a really strange error when I tried to configure the database with powershell

While there is still no DVCS, there are a lot of improvements with the introduction of local workspaces.
Actually TFS Workspaces status is kept on the server, so whenever you issue a GetLatest, the server check the status of the Workspace and send you only new data.

This operation can seem complex, but it is instead really simple.

First of all I created a simple virtual machine in hyper-v, install WindowsXP SP3, and did all the update, except Internet explorer, so my system is fully updated with latest patch but with IE6.</description></item><item><title>Grab the highest changeset number in a workspace during a build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/04/grab-the-highest-changeset-number-in-a-workspace-during-a-build/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2010 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/04/grab-the-highest-changeset-number-in-a-workspace-during-a-build/</guid><description>In a very old post I explained how to grab (with API) the latest changeset number during a build to use for assembly numbering, but I need to do a correction, after a comment on the post.

A custom activity does not contain any code at all and it is only composed by sub activities. This kind of customization is really useful to create pieces of workflow that will be inserted in main build workflow. As an example I created a simple custom activity to deploy a database project on a custom Database Server.</description></item><item><title>Use Msbuild Custom Action in TFS2010 build with a custom project</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/11/use-msbuild-custom-action-in-tfs2010-build-with-a-custom-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2009 13:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/11/use-msbuild-custom-action-in-tfs2010-build-with-a-custom-project/</guid><description>Since TFS Build 2010 is ruled by workflow foundation, what happens if you want to use a custom msbuild task that you already have used in the past?

It is possible to decide to copy outputs to drop folder, if you want a work item automatically created when the build fails, if tests must be disabled.</description></item><item><title>TF255352 and TF255331 warning during tfs 2010 beta2 install</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/tf255352-and-tf255331-warning-during-tfs-2010-beta2-install/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2009 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/tf255352-and-tf255331-warning-during-tfs-2010-beta2-install/</guid><description>This can happen when you change machine name after you installed and configured sql server.

Another interesting stuff to explain is how to execute custom code during the build, to demonstrate this concept I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to tweet a warning message when test phase fails.
