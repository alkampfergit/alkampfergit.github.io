It is a draft on a presentation for a course on Unit Testing and I wanted to spend some time to design it to resemble a Metro interface, because I liked it really much :).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Feel free to give me any comments/suggestion/critics on the appearance of the slide, and feel free to use it as a base for your presentation if you liked the appearance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CanResizeWithGrip seems does not work in WPF</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/canresizewithgrip-seems-does-not-work-in-wpf/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2011 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/06/canresizewithgrip-seems-does-not-work-in-wpf/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have an application that is built with a Metro-Like UI, so each windows has no border and can be resized with the ResizeMode equal to CanResizeWithGrip.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Figure 1&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>: &lt;em>The windows can be resized by a little grip on the bottom right border of the window&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created another view, use a similar layout from the preceding one, but this time the little grip to resize the windows does not appear in the windows.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
