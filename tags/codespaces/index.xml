Azure DevOps has supported symbol server functionalities for a considerable time, making it straightforward to add steps in your build process for indexing your source code. This capability enables you to publish your .NET libraries to either an internal or public NuGet feed and facilitates stepping into the original source code for debugging directly within Visual Studio.</description></item><item><title>Develop locally with GitHub Codespaces and Hugo</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/codespaces-hugo-local/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/codespaces-hugo-local/</guid><description>I really love Using Hugo and Codespaces to write blog posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve a really better blogging experience than wordpress, because I have a simple blog, quick to load, no frills no fuzzes, just a simple blog. Using Codespaces is really nice experience and I really never wrote a blog post in my Windows machine until yesterday.
Yesterday I simply opened my blog repository inside a local instance of Visual Studio Code, but I had a nasty surprise when I tried to start hugo server.</description></item><item><title>Configure Codespaces for Python projects</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/codespaces-python/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/codespaces-python/</guid><description>One of the great advantage of Codespaces is the ability to preconfigure the environment so you do not need to waste time installing and configuring your toolchain. Python is a perfect example of this scenario, I&amp;rsquo;ve a small project to generate Git Graph Representation and since I&amp;rsquo;m not a full time Python developer, I&amp;rsquo;ve not it installed and perfectly configured in all of my environment. Also I primarily work on Windows, so Codespaces allows me to test everything on Linux with a single click.</description></item><item><title>Configure Codespaces for a real project</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/configuring-codespaces/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/configuring-codespaces/</guid><description>In previous post I explored the many advantages I&amp;rsquo;ve found using GitHub codespaces to author blog posts directly in a browser. That example was surely too simple, after all a hugo blog is just markdown, but nevertheless Codespaces allows me to configure my environment with great easy.
You can follow the guide on the official link but here is a quick summary on how I configured my codespaces for my blog.</description></item><item><title>Use GitHub codespaces to author blog post</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/codespaces-hugo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/github/codespaces-hugo/</guid><description>The scenario I played a little bit with GitHub Codespaces when it was in preview, now it is time to try to use it real activities to understand scenarios where it can be useful.
To have a real test you need to setup a goal to verify if the tool is capable of reaching that goal, and if it is an advantage over existing tool. My first goal is being able to write Blog Post in hugo with GitHub Codespaces and being able to determine if it is more productive than running a standalone local version of Visual Studio code.</description></item></channel></rss>
