If I should give you a single reason to upgrade to this new version, is the new Test Runner that now has the ability to show tests hierarchically Figure 1: Hierarchical view in action in Test Explorer.
Since I’m a great NUnit fan, I always like the ability to see my tests following the namespace structure of my test projects, this is surely much more better than a flat list.</description></item><item><title>VSTS build failed test phase but 0 tests failed</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/11/vsts-build-failed-test-but-0-test-failed/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Nov 2017 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2017/11/vsts-build-failed-test-but-0-test-failed/</guid><description>I had a strange situation where I have a build that suddenly starts signal failing tests, but actually zero test failed.

A UAT or integration test is a test that exercise the entire application, sometimes composed by several services that are collaborating to create the final result. The difference from UAT tests and Integration test, in my personal terminology, is that the UAT uses direct automation of User Interface, while an integration tests can skip the UI and exercise the system directly from public API (REST, MSMQ Commands, etc).</description></item><item><title>Manage Environment Variables during a TFS VSTS Build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/08/manage-environment-variables-during-a-tfs-vsts-build/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2016 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/08/manage-environment-variables-during-a-tfs-vsts-build/</guid><description>To avoid creating unnecessary build definition, it is a best practice to allow for parameter overriding in every task that can be executed from a build.

Environment variables are not source controlled, this allows every developer to override settings in own machine without disturbing other developers.</description></item><item><title>Create Parametrized test to allow for simpler Builds</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/06/create-parametrized-test-to-allow-for-simpler-builds/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2016 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/06/create-parametrized-test-to-allow-for-simpler-builds/</guid><description>When it is time of running unit test in a TFS or TeamCity Build, often you face the problem to run tests with options different from those one used in Developer Machine.

When you are doing Test Driven Development you usually go with Red/Green/Refactor workflow; what you need is a way to quickly run all or part of your unit tests after you modified the code. The quickest solution is using the option to Run Tests After Build but it is available only for Premium and Ultimate edition, but you can also run test with little manual intervention resorting to Keyboard Shortcut.</description></item><item><title>Nunit test not found for some assemblies with Visual Studio Test Runner</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/04/nunit-test-not-found-for-some-assemblies-with-visual-studio-test-runner/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 12:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2015/04/nunit-test-not-found-for-some-assemblies-with-visual-studio-test-runner/</guid><description>I’ve a project in Visual Studio 2013 where one of the assembly containing Tests refuses to show tests in Test Explorer window.

You can create your first Coded UI test following simple instruction from MSDN documentation. Most of the introductory examples shows you how you can use the Recorder tools to record interaction with a software (Web, WinForm, Wpf. etc) to generate what is called a UiMap. An UiMap is nothing more than a big Xml files where the recorder records the interaction with the UI and a bunch of automatic generated classes to interact with the UI.</description></item><item><title>Code coverage during TFS 2012 build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/06/code-coverage-during-tfs-2012-build/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2013 05:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/06/code-coverage-during-tfs-2012-build/</guid><description>A common question about TFS 2012 build is: how can I ask for code coverage?
The answer is really simple, you should go to the test section of build definition and change the run settings from Default to another setting that includes code coverage and this is really everything you need to do.
Figure 1: Change run settings to enable code coverage
Now launch the build and verify that you have your binaries instrumented and Code Coverage correctly computed.</description></item><item><title>Shim and InstanceBehavior fallthrough to isolate part of the SUT</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/05/shim-and-instancebehavior-fallthrough-to-isolate-part-of-the-sut/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 May 2012 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/05/shim-and-instancebehavior-fallthrough-to-isolate-part-of-the-sut/</guid><description>I’ve dealt in a previous post with the new Shim library in Vs11 that permits you to test “difficult to test code” and I showed a really simple example on how to use Shim to isolate the call to DateTime.Now to simulate passing time in a Unit Test.

Code written without Unit Testing in mind is usually not so easy to test and when is time to modify code written by other, if you want to create a safety net of Unit Tests to avoid breaking code it is usually an hard task. The main problem is hardcode dependency from static functions because you cannot test a single function or method in isolation, forcing you to use pattern like Back door manipulation that makes test difficult to read, write and maintain.</description></item><item><title>Running NUnit and xUnit tests in TFS11 build</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/running-nunit-and-xunit-tests-in-tfs11-build/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2012 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/running-nunit-and-xunit-tests-in-tfs11-build/</guid><description>I’ve blogged in the past various solution to run NUnit tests during a TFS build, and now it is time to make it again for TFS11, but this time it is incredibly simple, because the new Test Runner supports multiple frameworks, so it works almost automatically.

I’m collecting a series of helpers class I written over time for NUNIT and I’m now able to write simple test like this.</description></item><item><title>More fluent on Nunit</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/12/more-fluent-on-nunit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2007 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/12/more-fluent-on-nunit/</guid><description>In the previous post I talked about nunit and fluent interface, I did some modification, now I can write
[Test]
publicvoid TestSimpleEqualsConditionedProperty3() {
SimpleThreeProps obja = newSimpleThreeProps(“test”, 15, “EQ”);
SimpleThreeProps objb = newSimpleThreeProps(“test”, 1, “EQ”);
Assert.That(obja, MyIs.SomePropertiesEqualTo(objb, “PropA”, “ThirdProperty”)
.And.Property(“PropB”).GreaterThan(14));
}
Now I can check for equality with a list of properties but added support to create constraint over the single property using the basic property constraint of nunit.

This is needed so the Controller does not work directly with the form but instead with an interface such as IShippingUi. But what happens when the function of the controller are invoked not by the main thread that rules the UI&amp;hellip;the result is an exception.</description></item><item><title>Complex fixture teardown</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/09/complex-fixture-teardown/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2007 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/09/complex-fixture-teardown/</guid><description>Download the code of the post.
Have you ever deal with tests having really complex fixtures? Sometimes it happens for projects that are not designed for testability, quite often you need to refactor, you begin to prepare a series of basic tests, but the interactions between the components of the system are really complex, and when a test gone wrong the whole suite is compromised. Yesterday I dealed with a series of tests that needed a really complex fixture, composed by classes that opened sockets and did all sort of complex thing (remoting, socket, shared variable, etc etc).</description></item><item><title>WatiN and weird names of aspnet controls</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/05/watin-and-weird-names-of-aspnet-controls/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2007 00:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/05/watin-and-weird-names-of-aspnet-controls/</guid><description>Asp.Net gives to HTML controls weird names, composed by the hierarchy of control used to generate the page. This causes problems for example writing WatiN test, because we cannot use Find.ById or use the Id of the control, because if we will change the layout of the page the name of the controls will change.
One of the possible solution is to use regular expression, using a regex that will search for controls that ends with a specific string value.</description></item><item><title>WatiN recorder</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/05/watin-recorder/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 May 2007 23:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/05/watin-recorder/</guid><description>Recently I discovered WatiN library to automate testing of web site with IE. This library is very useful, but sometimes writing test is a tedious process, for this reason there are some freeware recorder that are able to record a navigation in IE and automatically create code for WatiN test. One tool is WatinTestRecord, available here, it is a good product, and it’s freeware. Another product is Watin Recorder Avaliable here.</description></item><item><title>Design for testability</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/05/design-for-testability/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 May 2007 22:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/05/design-for-testability/</guid><description>Testing a web application can be challenging, there are a lot of tools to accomplish such a difficult task, replay browser capable of recording the input of the user, library as nUnit Asp.NET or WatiN, but in my opinion the best way to do unit testing on a site, is design the site itself to be testable. In the example attached with this article I show a very simple asp.net page to add two integer number together starting from a canonical version to a more testable form.</description></item></channel></rss>
