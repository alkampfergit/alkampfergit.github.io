The usual question from other dev in the team is “how can I simulate HTTPS to work with WCF?”
The problem arise that to test https sites, people usually work with IIS self issued certificates.
Figure 1: Self-Signed certificate in IIS
This works great for sites, you can use the auto signed certificate in your sites in https binding, then when you navigate to the site you usually got an error because the certificate is not issued for the right site.</description></item><item><title>Use AspNet Membership provider with a WCF svc service</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/09/use-aspnet-membership-provider-with-a-wcf-svc-service/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2009 02:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/09/use-aspnet-membership-provider-with-a-wcf-svc-service/</guid><description>Yesterday I literally lost 4 hours trying to do the following thing: Exposing a wcf service with wsHttpBinding, and using the same asp.net membership database used by the site. I encountered many problems, and I decided to write this post to explain the steps that makes everything work for me. First of all you need to know that fact: if you want to use asp.net membership in a wcf service exposed with wsHttpBinding you need to use certificates , and this causes most of the problems.</description></item></channel></rss>
