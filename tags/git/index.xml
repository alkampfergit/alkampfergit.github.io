It can basically work in many ways, but the easiest is importing commit as json in an HTML page.
Thanks to very few lines of Python code I realized a simple POC that is able to use git log to extract log as json then create an html page with extracted json that renders a simple png with the full history.</description></item><item><title>Azure DevOps Git repository options</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2020/02/azure-devops-git-repository-options/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2020 17:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2020/02/azure-devops-git-repository-options/</guid><description>Azure DevOps is a big product and often users start using it without fully explore all the possibilities. As an example, when it is time to work with Git Repositories, users just create repositories and start working without any further configuration.
If you navigate to the Repos section of Project Settings page, you can configure lots of options for repositories. Security is probably the most important setting, because it determines who can access that specific repository and what permission each user / group has in the context of that very specific repository.</description></item><item><title>Git and the Hell of case sensitiveness</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/12/git-and-the-hell-of-case-sensitiveness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2018/12/git-and-the-hell-of-case-sensitiveness/</guid><description>If you know how git works, you are perfectly aware that, even if you work in operating systems with case insensitive file system, all commit are case sensitive.
