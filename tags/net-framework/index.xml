The problem is that the library is really not CLS compliant and when I converted this project, (that contains 54 classes) I got ~ 2000 compilation errors.</description></item><item><title>Regular expression and performances</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/regular-expression-and-performances/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2009 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/10/regular-expression-and-performances/</guid><description>Regular expressions are really powerful, but sometimes they can be quite slow, especially when you have to deal with large amount of data.

To avoid this problem, (as my friend Lorenzo pointed me out), when you import the database structure, with the Database Project wizard, you must not select the Import log and filegroup file size.
If you deselect this option the import wizard does not check the actual file size of the database that is being imported.

Binary serialization is a technique used to obtain a binary representation of an object, and then rebuild that object from it back to a real instance in memory.
Serialization is a process that permits to convert the state of an object into a form that can be stored into some durable medium (file, DB) to rebuild original object in the future or to send the object to another process or computer through network channels.</description></item><item><title>Binary versus Xml Serialization size</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/10/binary-versus-xml-serialization-size/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2008 03:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2008/10/binary-versus-xml-serialization-size/</guid><description>Yesterday a friend of DotNetMarche asked me this question: I have the need to store serialized objects into database , I can choose between binary or xml format, which is smaller in size?

With this post we can begin to have more fun, first of all I modified the visitor to show the exact tree of the expression. Here is a screenshot
As you can see the structure of the lambda is more clear, the original lambda contains an Add Expression that in turns contains two parameter expression.</description></item><item><title>BindingListFind and NotImplementedException</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/10/bindinglistfind-and-notimplementedexception/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Oct 2007 05:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/10/bindinglistfind-and-notimplementedexception/</guid><description>BindingList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; is a great class to do binding to list of custom objects, it implements IBindingList for you, giving the ability to use the BindingList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; as datasource for the BindingSource control. But when you cast the BindingList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; to the IBindingList interface and try to call Find() Method you’ll get a NotImplementedException, how can it be possible?. The reason for this can be found here, but the real question is, it is possible to build a better BindingList that supports a generic Find() for properties of a business object?</description></item><item><title>Generate code with CodeDom</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/09/generate-code-with-codedom/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2007 04:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/09/generate-code-with-codedom/</guid><description>Code generators are really useful because they could cut down the time needed to write tedious code. There are a very good code generator called CodeSmith, with an old version that is freeware, but it is possible to generate code with own code with the help of CodeDom. CodeDom namespace contains a lot of classes useful to define code that can be generated in various languages by a specific CodeDomProvider, let’s see an example.</description></item><item><title>IRepositoryT and query objects</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/08/irepository-and-query-objects/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Aug 2007 22:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/08/irepository-and-query-objects/</guid><description>When you use a generic Interface for repository pattern there is always the problem of Query object. If you use nhibernate you can use Criteria API, but if you want to make your code not dependent by the ORM used, you often need to implement your Criteria Query. The most annoying problem with this approach is duplication of code, this because you usually create your query object and the concrete repository must translate from the Custom Query Object to the query object supported by the ORM framework.</description></item><item><title>NGenerics</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/06/ngenerics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jun 2007 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/06/ngenerics/</guid><description>If you like me are tired of.NET standard IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; that does not offer a lot of method to do sorting, filtering and more, you can have a look at NGenerics, a complete library composed of a lot of classes to satisfy all the need you can have to store data. You have algorithms for Graph for math, data structures and a lot more. What I really love are the classes for sorting, ranging from bubblesort, quicksort and a lot more.</description></item><item><title>Standard configuration for net 20</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/06/standard-configuration-for-net-20/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jun 2007 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2007/06/standard-configuration-for-net-20/</guid><description>I’m trying to develop a little framework to include in future projects, actually I had classes and project spread around partition D F and G, and I realized that I’m not really a tidy person :D. At this moment I only had written some classes to handle access to db with direct Sql, and I really liked used Anonymous delegate as did ayende in one of his post. At a certain point I faced the problem to decide where to save the setting of the project, for example the main connectionString.</description></item></channel></rss>
