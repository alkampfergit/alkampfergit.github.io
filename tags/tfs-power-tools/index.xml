In my laptop I&amp;rsquo;ve installed VS2008, team explorer and the latest power tools (&lt;a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c255a1e4-04ba-4f68-8f4e-cd473d6b971f">August 2011&lt;/a>), then I mapped a workspace from VS2008, but when I right click on mapped folder, no &lt;em>Team Foundation Server&lt;/em> menu appears in contextual menu.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use credential manager to use TFS shell extension in a workgroup or outside a domain</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/03/use-credential-manager-to-use-tfs-shell-extension-in-a-workgroup-or-outside-a-domain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2011 14:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/03/use-credential-manager-to-use-tfs-shell-extension-in-a-workgroup-or-outside-a-domain/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday I&amp;rsquo;ve blogged about TFS Power tools Shell Extension, and today my friend &lt;a href="http://dotnetcampania.org/blogs/michele/">Michele&lt;/a> told me that he has a problem, the extension always told him to Reconnect to server and he is not able to use them.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is probably due to an authentication request, so you can try to open Team Explorer, and if it asks for credential on connecting to TFS this is the reason. Shell extension are not able to ask for different user, so if you are outside the TFS domain or if you are in workgroup the only solution is going to Control Panel and fire the Credential Manager.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
