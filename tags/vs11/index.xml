Now I want to change a little bit the perspective of the test, in the test showed in previous post I simply exercise the sut calling Execute() a couple of time, simulating the time that pass between the two calls.</description></item><item><title>Using Shims in Visual Studio 11 to test untestable code</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/using-shims-in-visual-studio-11-to-test-untestable-code/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Apr 2012 20:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/using-shims-in-visual-studio-11-to-test-untestable-code/</guid><description>I always strive myself to write testable code, but it is not always easy, especially if you do not follow TDD red-green-refactor mantra. Code written without Unit Testing in mind is usually not so easy to test and when is time to modify code written by other, if you want to create a safety net of Unit Tests to avoid breaking code it is usually an hard task. The main problem is hardcode dependency from static functions because you cannot test a single function or method in isolation, forcing you to use pattern like Back door manipulation that makes test difficult to read, write and maintain.</description></item><item><title>VS11 gives you a fantastic XAML Editor</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/vs11-gives-you-a-fantastic-xaml-editor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Mar 2012 14:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/vs11-gives-you-a-fantastic-xaml-editor/</guid><description>XAML editing in Visual Studio 2010 is not one of the most exiting experience you can have, it works, but compared to Blend it is really poor. One of the thing I really do not like is the lack of information on design time data. Since I really develop every XAML application with MVVM or MVVM like approach, I always have design time data and I’d like Visual Studio to be able to use it during binding operation.</description></item><item><title>Interesting links for Visual Studio 11 and TFS 11</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/interesting-links-for-visual-studio-11-and-tfs-11/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2012 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/interesting-links-for-visual-studio-11-and-tfs-11/</guid><description>Yesterday Microsoft released a really huge wave of tools as well as the consumer preview of the upcoming operating system Windows 8.
