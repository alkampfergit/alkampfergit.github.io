The most annoying part of Coded UI Test is that &lt;strong>while they are running you cannot do anything else on the computer, because mouse and UI are used to run the test&lt;/strong>.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Test method TestProject.CodedUITest1.NavigateNablasoftTest threw exception: &lt;br>
Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITest.Extension.TechnologyNotSupportedException: The * &lt;strong>selected version of Mozilla Firefox is not supported&lt;/strong> *for playback. Go to &lt;a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=157214">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=157214&lt;/a> for information on available add-in for possible support.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This happens because FF 4.x is still not supported, but you can download and install FF 3.6 and use them side by side, just select a custom installation and select a different folder to install both of them (I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen c:\program files\Firefox 3.6) and you should be able to install FF 3.6 along with FF 4.x (it is a requirement for web developers that want to check how sites renders on both version of FF browser).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
