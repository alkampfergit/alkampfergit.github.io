Everything starts with the definition of a Test Case in a Test suite, in this example I want to verify what happens when the user insert some specific quantity in the Chart page of TailSpin toys.</description></item><item><title>Testing capabilities in TFS 2010</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/10/testing-capabilities-in-tfs-2010/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2010 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/10/testing-capabilities-in-tfs-2010/</guid><description>In TFS 2010 testing capabilities are really exceptional, and I&amp;rsquo;m not referring to testing tools that actually permits to record and replay web pages, CUIT etc, but I&amp;rsquo;m referring to the possibility to do a serious management of test plans for your projects.
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in the past team doing test plan management with Excel, and if you are managing your test plan with Excel&amp;hellip;you have a problem. The reason is that Excel is not a tool designed to manage Test Cases, you can clearly use it to write down your test, but it is difficult to integrate it into your ALM process and really difficult to read.</description></item><item><title>Intellitrace for aspnet application does not get collected during a test run with MTM</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/07/intellitrace-for-asp-net-application-does-not-get-collected-during-a-test-run-with-mtm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2010 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/07/intellitrace-for-asp-net-application-does-not-get-collected-during-a-test-run-with-mtm/</guid><description>If you have problem collecting intellitrace during a test run with MTM for an asp.net web application, and you really checked everything but cannot find any clue, check the user you are using to run the application. I have an installation where, using the default application pool will result in intellitrace being collected, while if I use a domain user to run application pool, when I try to signal a bug from MTM, no intellitrace is in the bug&amp;rsquo;s attachment.</description></item></channel></rss>
