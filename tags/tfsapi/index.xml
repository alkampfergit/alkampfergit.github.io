The sad part is that you can do it only for the latest version of the code and not for the entire history of all files. Suppose you want to do a simple Proof Of Concept to insert all content of all C# source code files in some search server (Es Solr, or Elastic Search) how it can be done with TFVC ?</description></item><item><title>Associate Work Items to Git commit in TF Service with API Calls</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/06/associate-work-items-to-git-commit-in-tf-service-with-api-calls/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2013 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/06/associate-work-items-to-git-commit-in-tf-service-with-api-calls/</guid><description>I’ve already blogged how to associate Work Items with TFS Check-ins using tags in comment and a bunch of Api Calls. This feature is now available for any TF Service based on Git, but someone asked me how can you accomplish this task with API. A possible scenario would be supporting different type of comment syntax and in general to understand how this task can be accomplished though API.
The code is really similar to the one I’ve posted in the other article, the only differences is comments are taken from Git commit and not from changeset checkins.</description></item><item><title>Copy TFS queries between iterations</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/03/copy-tfs-queries-between-iteractions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2011 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/03/copy-tfs-queries-between-iteractions/</guid><description>In an old post I spoke about a simple routine to copy queries between iterations in TFS, now it is time to show the code, behind this simple command.
Everything is really simple, the first step is creating a connection with the TFS server and retrieve a reference to QueryHierarchy object
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 string userName = GetParameterValue&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;(&amp;#34;user&amp;#34;); string password = GetParameterValue&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;(&amp;#34;pwd&amp;#34;); TfsTeamProjectCollection tfs = new TfsTeamProjectCollection(new Uri(GetParameterValue&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;(&amp;#34;collection&amp;#34;)), new NetworkCredential(userName, password)); string projectName = GetParameterValue&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;(&amp;#34;teamproject&amp;#34;); WorkItemStore store = (WorkItemStore) tfs.</description></item><item><title>How to get TFS server address from a local folder mapped to a workspace</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/09/how-to-get-tfs-server-address-from-a-local-folder-mapped-to-a-workspace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2010 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/09/how-to-get-tfs-server-address-from-a-local-folder-mapped-to-a-workspace/</guid><description>Sometimes you need to operate to a Tfs Version Control System with API starting from a local folder. There are a lot of API to work with workspaces, but the main problem is that you need to pass through a VersionControlServer object, and to obtain such an object you need to know the address of the Tfs server the workspace is mapped to?
The exercise is the following one :) – Write a snippet of code, based on TFS API that, given a local path, retrieve ChangesetId that is currently mapped on the workspace.</description></item><item><title>Create a Work Item By code in TFS returns TF237124 Work Item is not ready to save</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/05/create-a-work-item-by-code-in-tfs-returns-tf237124-work-item-is-not-ready-to-save/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2010 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/05/create-a-work-item-by-code-in-tfs-returns-tf237124-work-item-is-not-ready-to-save/</guid><description>Today my dear friend Matteo asked me some help with a snippet of code to insert a WIT into a TFS.
