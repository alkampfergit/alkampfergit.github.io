I do not work much on Linux, but usually I have Linux boxes with MongoDB, Elasticsearch and play with security related stuff and for those purposes I have dedicated virtual machines.
This was the reason why I did not found any real useful usage for WSL, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to quick do NMAP scan, but I got errors since it did not run a real Linux full kernel and NMap wants to have full access to the NIC to do its stuff.</description></item></channel></rss>
