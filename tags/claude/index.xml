The more freedom given to the model, the more the result can deviate from your needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using a model to help write detailed specifications is an easy way to accomplish this. This allows you to quickly generate good, detailed specs that you can manually refine. I often use various models with Open Web UI for this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that Claude Code offers agents, and creating an agent is simple, I immediately tried creating agents to automate this process. The results are promising, but not perfect. Claude Code seems focused on writing code and tends to over-deliver. Starting with a simple idea and asking Claude Code to create an agent for brainstorming detailed specifications yields good results, but how good are they?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
