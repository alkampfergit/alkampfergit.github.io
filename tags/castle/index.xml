To make this work, an interdependency library is typically used to allow ASP.NET Core infrastructure to resolve dependencies using Castle. This approach helps avoid issues when replacing Castle with other libraries, since Castle is both powerful and complex, allowing for many customizations in dependency resolution.</description></item><item><title>Decide when CastleWindsor Startable Facility starts your components</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/05/decide-when-castle-windsor-startable-facility-starts-your-components/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2016 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2016/05/decide-when-castle-windsor-startable-facility-starts-your-components/</guid><description>Castle.Windsor Startable facility is a nice facility that automatically starts component that implements a specific interface (IStartable) or components registered with specific extensions method (ex StartUsingMethod).
This approach is really nice, and the Facility has different way to work, the old aggressive mode that try to start a component immediately after is registered, and another, more useful, that starts a component only when all its dependencies are registered. This feature is helpful, because it avoid you to worry about order of registration.</description></item><item><title>Exposing WCF service without svc extension</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/03/exposing-wcf-service-without-svc-extension/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2013 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2013/03/exposing-wcf-service-without-svc-extension/</guid><description>I know, this is a weird requirement, but sometimes they appear in your backlog.

Since MEF is not born to handle dependencies, you will probably use other libraries for DI, Es. Castle.Windsor. Now the problem is “how can I make MEF and my IoC container living together happily with minimum effort?”. To keep everything simple you will need to understand typical scenario, you want to solve, a first problem you need to solve is “ Mef imported classes should be able to declare dependencies on services defined in my primary IoC container engine§.</description></item><item><title>Moving between different IoC containers</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/07/moving-between-different-ioc-containers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2012 20:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/07/moving-between-different-ioc-containers/</guid><description>I must admit that I always prefer castle Windsor over other IoC containers, but the main reason is that I’m really used to it and all its facilities. I know how to write facilities, and I know how it behave, this makes difficult for me moving to other Container because I usually need time to find how to do same stuff I do with castle with the new Toy.
Actually I’m using Unity sometimes and today I need to mimic the IStartable facility of Castle , because I need Start method to be called whenever the object gets registered, and stop called when the container is disposed.</description></item><item><title>Managing remote logging with Log4net and WCF</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/09/managing-remote-logging-with-log4net-and-wcf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2011 14:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/09/managing-remote-logging-with-log4net-and-wcf/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve applications that can work in two distinct configuration, they are based on WPF and MVVM, where the VM communicates with the Domain / Business Logic through services like IXxxxService.

When the software is used internally, it has direct access to the Database, so I configure castle to use the concrete class of the various services, but when the software is deployed to external users, who have no access to the intranet, all communication is done through WCF.</description></item><item><title>Lifecycle of singleton objects</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/05/lifecycle-of-singleton-objects/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2011 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/05/lifecycle-of-singleton-objects/</guid><description>Some days ago I blogged about an implementation of persistent cache component based on Managed Esent and PersistentDictionary. This component is injected into other components thanks to Inversion of Control and it is a Singleton object.
Being a singleton is a requisite because it permits to different dependent objects to share the same cache, moreover PersistentDictionary does not permit to have multiple instances that insists on the same directory. This will make EsentCache a perfect candidate of Singleton Object Pattern.</description></item><item><title>AoP with castle part 4-Adding AoP to service oriented App</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/02/aop-with-castle-part-4adding-aop-to-service-oriented-app/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Feb 2011 09:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/02/aop-with-castle-part-4adding-aop-to-service-oriented-app/</guid><description>Previous Parts of the series

AOP works great if you have clear interfaces where you want to put some standard and shared logic, and a Service Oriented Application falls in this category. A service is just a bunch of methods that will share some common behavior like: Validation, logging, Security etc etc, so it is a good strategy to create interceptors for each one of this behavior and associate them to service classes.</description></item><item><title>Castle and Automock avoid resolving properties</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/castle-and-automock-avoid-resolving-properties/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2010 14:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/11/castle-and-automock-avoid-resolving-properties/</guid><description>I use AutoMockingContainer extensively in my test projects, and I ‘ve build over time an automocking container that satisfy all of my needs.

Usually the very first interceptor you can build with an AOP framework is the logger Interceptor, because it is simple and useful, especially when you expose some services with WPF.

Part 1 – The basic of interception
Some people, after looking at interceptor concept, are not fully convinced that castle can support all concepts of AOP and the first question usually is: How can I choose witch method intercept, instead of intercepting calls to all methods, and how can I configure this with XML file or fluent configuration?. This answer can have various solutions, but in my opinion the simplest one is doing a little manual logic on interceptor.</description></item><item><title>Aop With castle Part 1</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/06/aop-with-castle-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2010 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/06/aop-with-castle-part-1/</guid><description>I made a session about Aop with castle in a Italian workshop oranized by our association DotNetMarche, and some of the attendee asked me to publish the material in my blog.

The software is structured as service, we use Castle Nhibernate Facility and Wcf Integration Facility plus a simple interceptor that manages the concept of Single session per service call.
