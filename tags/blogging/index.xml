When you deploy regularly your product in an automatic way, you need to minimize the risk that new code can break existing one and having other members of the team to review the code increment, is an invaluable feature.</description></item><item><title>Moving old posts from WordPress to Hugo</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/general/conversion-of-wordpress/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 19:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/general/conversion-of-wordpress/</guid><description>It was almost one year from my switch from WordPress to Hugo and I&amp;rsquo;m really really satisfied from the result. After some months the only thing that bother me is the fact that I still need to maintain an instance of WordPress just to keep old posts. The only thing that prevented me to migrate was the loss of comments, but actually, after looking to all of my old blog posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve not such a big amount of comments that worth migrating, the only thing that is important to me is the ability to keep my old post without comments so I can get rid of WordPress.</description></item><item><title>GitHub Codespaces first impression</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/general/github-codespaces-first-impression/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Sep 2020 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/general/github-codespaces-first-impression/</guid><description>What is GitHub codespaces Visual Studio Code is becoming one of the most used and productive editors in all operating system and it is used by most developers.

Sometimes you just need to go out from your comfort zone a little bit to change perspective and to find what you are doing wrong. Let me do an example: I used different plugins to print formatted code in my blog and after some migration you can see what happened to very first posts (around 2007).</description></item><item><title>Moving to Hugo</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/general/firstpost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2020 17:17:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/general/firstpost/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started blogging in English in 2007 and clearly the choice was WordPress. I must admit that in lots of years of WordPress I always was quite satisfied by the result, lots of plugin, lots of resources on the internet and the ability to post from programs like Windows Live Writer having a WYSIWYG program.
You can also read one of the first post where I enjoyed blogging in Word, really long time passed since that really old post.</description></item><item><title>Google probably does not like cloudflare</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/09/google-probably-does-not-like-cloudflare/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2012 13:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/09/google-probably-does-not-like-cloudflare/</guid><description>Iâ€™ve signed up months ago for a Cloudflare during a refactoring of my web site, at the same time I changed the theme of the blog, cleaned up a little bit the HTML of the page and optimized few stuffs. I was very satisfied of the gain of performance I got with Cloudflare, but after a month stats of blog started to went down.
The trend was continuous, each week traffic is slightly less than previous week and all traffic loss is mostly from Google organic.</description></item><item><title>Test posting in the future</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/07/test-posting-in-the-future/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2009 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/07/test-posting-in-the-future/</guid><description>Probably one of the most missed feature of wordpress is the possibility to post in the future. There are days when you have tons of ideas, but you simply avoid to blog just because you&amp;rsquo;ve already blogged a lot in the last days. One of the most interesting feature of wordpress, as well as other blog engine is the ability to post in the future.
The good stuff is that windows live writer is able to decide date of the post directly on the post page, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post 03 July 2009, but it will be published only the next day.</description></item></channel></rss>
