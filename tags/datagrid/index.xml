The very first problem is that &lt;strong>inside DataGridColumns the DataContext is not what you expect&lt;/strong>. Suppose you have this simple scenario in MVVM: &lt;em>an ObservableCollection of Objects, each one has IsSelected property and you want to bind that property to a DataGridCheckBox column with a CheckBox in the header that permits you to Select all and Unselect all&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wpf DataGrid poor performance on sorting</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/07/wpf-datagrid-poor-performance-on-sorting/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jul 2012 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/07/wpf-datagrid-poor-performance-on-sorting/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve a WPF View where with a simple &lt;strong>DataGrid that shows hundreds of rows&lt;/strong> , it all works fine until I added sorting capabilities; when I click on the header to sort content, it took almost 5 seconds to sort 500 elements, and this kind of performance is simply unacceptable. The first step was firing a profiler to understand &lt;em>where&lt;/em>  the code is slow, and I found this result.&lt;/p>
