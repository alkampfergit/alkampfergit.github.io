1 var noMatchRegex = new RegExp(&amp;#34;[\r\n\s;,$]+&amp;#34;); This regex basically should match a carriage return or a space or ; char, etc, but it appears not working sometimes. After a quick test I confirmed that the problem happens when I have string that contains the character ‘s’.</description></item><item><title>Disable Javascript error in WPF WebBrowser control</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/08/disable-javascript-error-in-wpf-webbrowser-control/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2010 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/08/disable-javascript-error-in-wpf-webbrowser-control/</guid><description>I work with WebBrowser control in WPF, and one of the most annoying problem I have with it, is that sometimes you browse sites that raise a lot of javascript errors and the control become unusable. Thanks to my friend Marco Campi, yesterday I solved the problem. Marco pointed me a link that does not deal with WebBrowser control, but uses a simple javascript script to disable error handling in a web page.</description></item></channel></rss>
