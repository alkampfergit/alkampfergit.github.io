The story is: as company XXX I want to expose a service based on WCF in IIS without having the.svc suffix in the address. I’m actually using Castle Windsor WCF Integration to resolve my service class with castle, and it turns out that exposing a service without using standard.svc files it is just a matter of configure routing.</description></item><item><title>Avoid WCF to test validity of HTTPS certificates</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/12/avoid-wcf-to-test-validity-of-https-certificates/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2012 14:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/12/avoid-wcf-to-test-validity-of-https-certificates/</guid><description>In a previous article I deal on How To test ssl based wcf service and part of the solution is to create a self issued certificate and make it valid inserting generated certificate in Trusted Root Certification Authority.
This operation makes that CA trusted and is an operation that is not so good if you really care on the security of your machine. There is also situation where you want to temporarily disable the check of the validity of the certificate, ES: you need to revoke certificate and issue another one with a new certification trusted authority , or basically you want your application to use a self issued https certificate in your intranet but you do not want to install that CA in everyone computer Trusted Root Certification Authority.</description></item><item><title>The username is not provided Specify username in ClientCredentials when use CreateChannel at Runtime</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/10/the-username-is-not-provided-specify-username-in-clientcredentials-when-use-createchannel-at-runtime/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2012 17:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/10/the-username-is-not-provided-specify-username-in-clientcredentials-when-use-createchannel-at-runtime/</guid><description>I’ve encountered a strange problem with WCF today, I have a custom Castle facility that is able to automatically create Wcf proxies with code , and it worked perfectly until I need to add a simple functionality: I want to be able to change at runtime some of the options of bindings that are configured in app.config. The solution was really simple, just write a method to retrieve the BindingConfiguration from the configuration file and the game is almost done.</description></item><item><title>Wcf over HTTPS compression binary binding and some measurement</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/09/wcf-over-https-compression-binary-binding-and-some-measurement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2012 20:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/09/wcf-over-https-compression-binary-binding-and-some-measurement/</guid><description>I’ve an application that is composed by WPF clients deployed over the internet and a central WCF service exposed over Https for security reason , everything works fine, but as the number of clients grows, performance starts to decrease a little.

I previously described a scenario where the customer needs a really basic Request Response service in WCF, the goal is being able to take advantage of a request / response structure, but with an approach like: “the simpliest thing that could possibly works”. This technique is usually needed to introduce new architectural concepts in a team without requiring people to learn a huge amount of concepts in a single shot, a scenario that could ends in a team that actively * fight the new architecture because it is too complex *.</description></item><item><title>Troubleshoot WCF exception</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/troubleshoot-wcf-exception/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2012 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/troubleshoot-wcf-exception/</guid><description>WCF is an exceptional library but sometimes it is hard to troubleshoot problems, especially when you start to encounter intermittent communication errors and you feel lost because you have no clue on where the error is. As an example I have a service that worked for a lot of time, then sometimes the client started to receive this error
The server did not provide a meaningful reply; this might be caused by a contract mismatch, a premature session shutdown or an internal server error The easiest way to troubleshoot this kind of error is to enable logging for WCF in the system.</description></item><item><title>Wcf error Keyset does not exist with security certificate</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/wcf-error-keyset-does-not-exist-with-security-certificate/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Apr 2012 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/wcf-error-keyset-does-not-exist-with-security-certificate/</guid><description>I worked a lot with WCF secured services and whenever is time to use certificates it is not uncommon to encounter strange and not so much descriptive exceptions. One of the less intuitive one is “ keyset does not exists with security certificate” , that basically means that the worker process in IIS is not able to access the service.
I’ve dealt with this problem in an old post, when I used self issued certificates to manage secure client/server communication between windows forms client and a service hosted in IIS, but the very same error happened yesterday trying to configure a net.</description></item><item><title>Reason behind a request 8211 response service in WCF</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/reson-behind-request-responseservice-in-wc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Apr 2012 16:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/04/reson-behind-request-responseservice-in-wc/</guid><description>I dealt with a minimal implementation of a basic Request Response WCF Service some times ago, now it is time to show some advantages you have using this approach. If the caller is created in.NET technology, you can directly reference the dll that contains all Requests and responses , without the need to create a service reference in Visual Studio. In my example the service is called CoreService, so I created a CoreServiceClient class to implement communication from client to server.</description></item><item><title>Basic Request Response WCF service</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/basic-request-response-wcf-service/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Mar 2012 07:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2012/03/basic-request-response-wcf-service/</guid><description>The concept of Request-Response service is to have an endpoint with a single function capable to handle a command (a Request) and return a Response, to have a single entry point of our service. There are a lot of architectures around the web based on WCF and this pattern and this old series of post are a really good example on how you can implement it in practice.
The only drawback is that sometimes these architectures are quite complex for the average programmer, at least you can introduce them in a team where everyone is quite familiar with concept of Inversion Of Control, Dependency Injection, etc etc.</description></item><item><title>How to test SSL based WCF services</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/11/how-to-test-ssl-based-wcf-services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2011 11:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2011/11/how-to-test-ssl-based-wcf-services/</guid><description>I usually work with WCF service that needs to be secured with Certificates or simply using HTTPS. The usual question from other dev in the team is “how can I simulate HTTPS to work with WCF?”
The problem arise that to test https sites, people usually work with IIS self issued certificates.
Figure 1: Self-Signed certificate in IIS
This works great for sites, you can use the auto signed certificate in your sites in https binding, then when you navigate to the site you usually got an error because the certificate is not issued for the right site.</description></item><item><title>Extending the WCF castle proxy generator</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/04/extending-the-wcf-castle-proxy-generator/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2010 13:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2010/04/extending-the-wcf-castle-proxy-generator/</guid><description>Since I&amp;rsquo;m using extensively the Wcf castle proxy generator today I needed to add a new feature, I need to be able to specify via code the base address of the various services.

Now I need to modify configuration, because in another project, all the site is forced over https, and the configuration I used in the other project cannot be used anymore. In older post in fact, I explained how to send credentials over http with message security, using self issued certificates. Now I have transport security, so I can avoid the need to distribute certificates to people that will use the service.</description></item><item><title>Generate a certificate for Wcf service with windows server 2003</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/09/generate-a-certificate-for-wcf-service-with-windows-server-2003/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2009 06:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2009/09/generate-a-certificate-for-wcf-service-with-windows-server-2003/</guid><description>In the previous post, I showed how to setup authentication with asp.net membership in wsHttpBinding for a Wcf server, and in that post I showed how to use the utility makecert.exe to generate temporary certificates.
