Failed to initialize CoreCLR, HRESULT: 0x80131500 * This happens because I installed the version for Ubuntu 14.04 and not the one specifically compiled for Ubuntu 16.04. In my situation the error happened because the download page of my VSTS account does not list the version for Ubuntu 16.</description></item><item><title>Grey screen RDP to Ubuntu server VM running on Azure</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/05/grey-screen-rdp-to-ubuntu-server-vm-running-on-azure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2014 20:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/05/grey-screen-rdp-to-ubuntu-server-vm-running-on-azure/</guid><description>There are a lot of articles that explains how to setup a Ubuntu machine on Azure and being able to use xrdp to access it with a standard Remote Desktop session.
