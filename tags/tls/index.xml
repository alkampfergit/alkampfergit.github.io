Now my goal is configuring data protection api for multiple instance of a software, so we need to share keys in a shared location and at the same time keep them secret. Luckily enough .NET core already has everything we need.
The overall solution will need two parameter to our program, Folder where to store keys and a certificate thumbprint to protect the keys.</description></item><item><title>Developers and TLS what could possibly go wrong</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/security/developers-and-tls/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2022 08:13:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/security/developers-and-tls/</guid><description>The problem of not using TLS in developer machines Lots of time ago, at the time Windows Communication Foundation was a thing, there were good automatic protections by Microsoft that prevent passing credentials in clear text over an unencrypted (non TLS) channel. I was amazed by the number of solution you can find in the internet that to solve the problem suggests to developer to create an unsecure channel that does not perform this check, allowing for clear text credential to be sent in a standard HTTP channel.</description></item></channel></rss>
