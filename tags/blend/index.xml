I usually keep VS and Blend togheter, in VS I change ViewModels and do everything not related to the UI, when I need to change the UI I simply switch to blend.
The problem is, Blend looks only in the bin\Debug folder, so when I add a Command or property to the viewmodel I compile the project, switch to blend&amp;hellip; and I&amp;rsquo;m not able to see the new property or command.</description></item></channel></rss>
