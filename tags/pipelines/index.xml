From a couple of days, in a project I&amp;rsquo;m working into the service started to return 401 even with the technique described in the aforementioned post.
The sympthom is this error in the script that executed dotnet restore command.

This time, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to avoid using Personal Access Tokens for authentication and switch to a more secure alternative.
