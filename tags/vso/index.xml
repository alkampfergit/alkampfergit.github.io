This capability is a key for success because ALM is really a complicated subject and rarely you can manage all of your applications with a single tools.
VSO and TFS are no exception to this rule, they are more a set of suites and tools glued together under a single brand.</description></item><item><title>How to connect existing VSO Account to new azure portal</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/07/how-to-connect-existing-vso-account-to-new-azure-portal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2014 10:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/07/how-to-connect-existing-vso-account-to-new-azure-portal/</guid><description>With the new deploy of Visual Studio Online you can link your existing VSO accounts to your azure subscription so they will be available on new Azure portal http://portal.azure.com.

Those article explain how you can build a WebService that listens for notification from TFS and react accordingly. If you are curious if this technique works also for Visual Studio Online, the answer is obviously YES !.
You can reuse the very same code for the previous example, because VSO uses the very same mechanism as TFS on-premise, so you can easily use the same service regardless you want to be notified from on-premise installation (using BisSubscribe.</description></item><item><title>Application Insights on Visual Studio Online</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/02/application-insights-on-visual-studio-online/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2014 08:00:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/post/old/2014/02/application-insights-on-visual-studio-online/</guid><description>Continuous deploy on Test and PreProduction server was always an argument that fascinates me a lot.
