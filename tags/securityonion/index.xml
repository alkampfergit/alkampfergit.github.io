As for the previous video I give a disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m not a Security Onion expert, and those video are meant to keep track of my progress and to help others to familiarize with the tool.
In first video I start from an alert from Strelka and then proceed to identify possible compromised machine in the network as well as finding external malicious IPs.</description></item></channel></rss>
