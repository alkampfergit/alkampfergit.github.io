I started playing with my first computer, a commodore Vic20 and I discovered that I really like programming. I had only 3.5 KB of memory for my programs and It seemed to me that computers will really change my life*.
I begin programming in Vic20 BASIC, then BASIC80, then I studied Pascal, Fortran (a little bit), a little bit of prolog and Cobol.</description></item><item><title>Git Videos</title><link>https://www.codewrecks.com/git-videos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.codewrecks.com/git-videos/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started to create some Git related videos in my YouTube profile, this post will collect all of them for easier access.
